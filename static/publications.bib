  abstract = {Programming interfaces are still monopolised by the typewriter and paper emulator display. This makes programming exclusionary towards anyone for whom such interfaces are unpleasant, unnatural or unusable. Further, this monopoly excludes every other human faculty that might be used to express unexpressed programs through unimagined means. To destablise this status quo, alternative programming models have been sought which are more amenable to a wider range of interfaces. We believe a complimentary approach to be broadening the search for programming interfaces by excluding the need for an explicit programming model at first. We present an experimental audio-tactile interface for sculpting digital resonance models using clay, along with preliminary reflections from a study with 34 musicians, luthiers and other craftspeople. We reflect on how tracing the emergence of tacit and embodied knowledge about an unfamiliar, implicit programming interface could inspire different ideas about programming models and other aspects of programming systems.},

  abstract = {Music technologies reflect the most advanced human technologies in most historical periods. Examples range from 40 thousand years old bone flutes found in caves in the Swabian Jura, through ancient Greek water organs or medieval Arabic musical automata, to today's electronic and digital instruments with deep learning. Music technologies incorporate the musical ideas of a time and place and they disseminate those ideas when adopted by other musical cultures. This article explores how contemporary music technologies are culturally conditioned and applies the concept of ethno-organology to describe the nature of migration of instruments between musical cultures.},

  abstract = {This paper describes physical and digital design strategies for the Feedback-Actuated Augmented Bass - a self-contained feedback double bass with embedded DSP capabilities. A primary goal of the research project is to create an instrument that responds well to the use of extended playing techniques and can manifest complex harmonic spectra while retaining the feel and sonic fingerprint of an acoustic double bass. While the physical con figuration of the instrument builds on similar feedback string instruments being developed in recent years, this project focuses on modifying the feedback behaviour through low-level audio feature extractions coupled to computationally lightweight filtering and amplitude management algorithms. We discuss these adaptive and time-variant processing strategies and how we apply them in sculpting the system's dynamic and complex behaviour to our liking.}

  abstract = {This paper reports upon the process of innovation of a new instrument. The author has developed the halldorophone a new electroacoustic string instrument which makes use of positive feedback as a key element in generating its sound.  An important objective of the project has been to encourage its use by practicing musicians. After ten years of use, the halldorophone has a growing repertoire of works by prominent composers and performers. During the development of the instrument, the question has been asked: ``why do musicians want to use this instrument?'' and answers have been found through on-going (informal) user studies and feedback. As the project progresses, a picture emerges of what qualities have led to a culture of acceptance and use around this new instrument. This paper describes the halldorophone and presents the rationale for its major design features and ergonomic choices, as they relate to the overarching objective of nurturing a culture of use and connects it to wider trends.},
