The Chowndolo is a digital instrument based on a magnetic pendulum. As the pendulum swings, its motion is disrupted by magnetic forces, creating unstable movements that are transformed into sound. The instrument is played by arranging magnetic tiles beneath the pendulum, altering its trajectory and reshaping the resulting sonic patterns. The interaction between the pendulum and the magnetic field produces a continuously shifting composition. As if guided by invisible hands, the Chowndolo channels the magic of magnetism, weaving a sonic spell where chaos and harmony entwine.

Beyond being an instrument, Chowndolo is an exploration of perception, making tangible the unseen interactions of magnetic fields. The installation invites the audience to experience sound as a direct consequence of physical forces, turning abstract movements into an organic and enchanting musical experience.

The name Chowndolo (from the Italian word "ciondolo" meaning "swinging
pendant") is a tribute to John Chowning, a pioneer in electronic composition and voice synthesis. The instrument creates sound using FM audio synthesis, which was discovered by Chowning 1967.

The Chowndolo is rooted in media archeology and sound art practices, reinterpreting past technologies to shape new artistic expressions. The project embraces the concept of  remediation—the way new media refashion old interactive paradigms. The pendulum, as symbol of time measurement from Galileo to atomic clocks, is here re-interpreted and becomes a generator of an unpredictable musical time, an inverted metronome dancing with hidden forces.

Key influences include Steve Reich’s Pendulum Music, William Forsythe’s kinetic installations, and experimental approaches like circuit bending and hardware hacking (e.g. Nicolas Collins, Paul DeMarinis). More than a device, Chowndolo is an invitation to interaction, inviting the audience to shape the composition by rearranging its elements. This aligns with a broader artistic ethos—rethinking technology as a process of reinterpretation, where physical and conceptual features are rediscovered.

A new iteration of the project—designed to withstand long-term public exhibitions—was developed with support from the Intelligent Instruments Lab, incorporating custom hardware and electronics created using digital fabrication techniques such as CNC machining, 3D printing, laser cutting, and powder coating.
