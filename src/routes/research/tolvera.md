[Tölvera](http://tolvera.is) is a Python library designed for [composing together](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06777) and interacting with [basal](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0750) [agencies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-023-04790-z). 
It provides creative coding-style APIs that allow users to combine and compose various built-in behaviours, such as flocking, slime mold growth, and swarming, and also author their own. 
With built-in support for Open Sound Control (OSC) via [iipyper](https://github.com/Intelligent-Instruments-Lab/iipyper) and interactive machine learning (IML) via [anguilla](https://github.com/Intelligent-Instruments-Lab/anguilla), Tölvera interfaces with and rapidly maps onto existing creative computing software and hardware, striving to be both an accessible and powerful tool for exploring [diverse intelligence](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.768201/full) in artistic contexts.

The word _Tölvera_ is an Icelandic [kenning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenning) based on _tölva_ meaning computer, from _tala_ (number) and _völva_ (prophetess), and _vera_ (being), composed together as _number being_.
