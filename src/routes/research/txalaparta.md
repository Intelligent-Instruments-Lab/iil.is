In this project we are teaching a computer to play an ancient Basque percussion instrument named txalaparta. It is typically played simultaneously by two players improvising in a call-and-response fashion and the goal is to get a computer to play along with a human txalaparta player. The instrument consists of a few long wooden planks that are beaten by special batons, which we have placed sensors on to abstract the human playing into data. The data is then fed into a system that processes it, learns its patterns, and responds with a prediction of when the next hit should be and which player will perform it. If all goes well, the computer will play along with a human txalaparta player in a convincing manner.
