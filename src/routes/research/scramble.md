<a href="https://thormagnusson.github.io/threnoscope/" title="Threnoscope">Scramble</a> and Scramble Live are two complementary MIDI tools for the real-time generation of polyphonic music. They combine the flexibility of Markov Chains for the generation of pitch transitions with the generalization capabilities offered by neural networks on the rhythmic and dynamic domains. 

Through an intuitive user interface, Scramble allows the user to perform the analysis of MIDI files, the training and generation of dinstinct models for pitch and time-related variables, controllable coupling and playback. 

Scramble Live relies on the models generated by Scramble, but allows for a higher degree of interaction: it incorporates the real time output of live instrumentalists, it offers dynamic model selection and switching, MIDI mapping and clock synchronization.
