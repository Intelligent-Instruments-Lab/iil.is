Stacco is a magnetic instrument that interacts with the player by attracting and repelling magnetic spheres and ferromagnetic objects. It is a playful instrument that allows the performer to control fine musical details if needed, but also to wonder freely into ferromegnetic sonic realms.

Under the hood Stacco features four magnetometers and as many magnetic attractors, it performs embedded synthesis with Bela or connects to a laptop for more demanding tasks. We are using Stacco as the ideal controller to perform with Neural Synthesis models such as RAVE, as it allows to finely control multiple parameters with simple gestures.

Stacco introduces a novel approach to music notation with neural audio synthesis, by allowing the user to draw trajectories and gestures on the top of the instrument itself. We refer to this approach embodied sketching. This method is being used in a series of workshops with artists aiming at understanding the possible compositional practices with neural synthesis, and investigate strategies to make the model more interpretable by the user.

We used Stacco in a number of performances, including solo sets, duos with two Staccos and in wider ensembles, including electronics and acoustic instruments. Mouja is a solo performance by Nicola Privato where Stacco is used as a Ouija board, in order to explore the latent space of layered RAVE models.

Magnetologues is a duo performance featuring two Stacco, played by Giacomo Lepri and Nicola Privato. One controls neural synthesis models and an FM synthesizer, the other one moves the sound in space on an Ambisonics dome using ICST Ambisonics. The performance was recorded at ZhdK, Zurich, for
