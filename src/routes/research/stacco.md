Stacco is a new knid of Magnetic Score that interacts with the player by attracting and repelling magnetic spheres and ferromagnetic objects. It is a playful instrument that allows the performer to control fine musical details if needed, but also to wonder freely into ferromegnetic sonic realms. Under the hood Stacco features four magnetometers and as many magnetic attractors, and since it features Bela it perform embedded synthesis or connect to a laptop for more demanding tasks. We are using Stacco as the ideal controller to perform with Neural Synthesis models such as RAVE, as it allows to finely control multiple parameters with simple gestures.
