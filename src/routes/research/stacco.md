Stacco is a musical instrument combining the playful properties of magnets and AI. Stacco incorporates models of different sound sources, such as flowing liquids, human voices, percussions, or old organs. These can be mixed with sliders and intuitively explored by manipulating magnetic spheres on the instrument’s surface. As the performer moves the spheres, Stacco’s magnetic forces influence their trajectories, allowing both nuanced musical control and the emergence of unpredictable sonic behaviours. 

Stacco opens up new ways of integrating AI in the musical experience, leveraging the liveness of magnetic interactions and embodied intuition. The instrument features a novel AI technology known as Neural Audio Synthesis. Here, machine learning models are trained on small datasets of sounds coming from different sources, which the algorithm learns to reconstruct in real time according to the user’s behaviour. 

Stacco comes with graphical scores that function as guides for the exploration of the sonic output of the neural synth. By drawing on the surface of the interface, it is also possible to create new scores and layer them on top of each other.
