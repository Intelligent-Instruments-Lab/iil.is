In this project we introduce textiles as a soft, malleable material for intelligent instruments.

Traditionally, musical instruments are made of rigid materials, such as wood. Interfaces for digital music making often feature plastic or metal - all materials that provide little ﬂexibility and can feel cold. To challenge these conventions, we ask how we can design instruments that are soft, warm, and ﬂexible. We are interested in how such materials can afford new ways of interaction. Textiles are one of those materials that we are ubiquitously surrounded by, in constant touch with, and therefore very familiar as an interface. 

Textiles come in diﬀerent structures, textures, and characteristics. We can stretch, squeeze, stroke them, even wear them and coat us in them. So, can we also make music with textiles? When we stretch a piece of fabric, can we make it stretch sound? How would we “play” textiles as a musical, intelligent instrument?

As an ongoing research project, these questions are addressed by turning textiles into sensing surfaces and actuators like speakers. Embedding conductive elements such as silver yarns or steel ﬁbres into textiles gives them electronic properties, hence they are called Electronic Textiles or E-Textiles. As such, they are able to act as gestural touch interfaces and can step into a conversation with digital tools.

At the Intelligent Instruments lab, e-textiles are now an integrated part of the OrganoLib, and have been explored as instruments through various designs and projects. For example, woven and knitted fabrics are used as mixing desks, and crocheted soft sculptures are turned into synthesisers. 

Inviting people to interact with these textile instruments, they have been exhibited at the Textile Intersections conference, and were part of jam sessions at the iil Open Lab.
