Magnetism is a playful and fascinating force, and one that can be used to convey information and suggest movement through the reciprocal, tangible interaction of magnetic fields.
_Magnetic Scores_ explore the compositional and expressive possibilities offered by permanent magnets both in the inscription of musical instructions and in controlling musical parameters through somatosensory feedback.
At the core of this project are two wireless controllers containing magnetic sensors and permanent magnets. Because the magnets are oriented with identical polarities, the controllers push on each other and generate the sensation of an object, that can be explored in order to produce sound. Alternatively, by embedding magnets in surfaces of different dimensions and orientation it is possible to compose a magnetic score that the performer can navigate with the controllers.
We are using machine learning in order to dynamically map the discs' reading with various sound engines, including Neural Synthesis, and exploring how this novel way of interfacing with them changes the way we understand their agency.
