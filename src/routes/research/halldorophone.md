The halldorophone (Icelandic: dórófónn) is a cello-like electronic instrument created by artist and designer Halldór Úlfarsson.

The halldorophone is designed specifically to feedback the strings and the instrument gained some recognition in early 2020 when composer Hildur Guðnadóttir won the Academy Award for her original soundtrack to the movie Joker, some of which was composed with a halldorophone.

In the ii halldorophone (or the bananophone) we have an embedded Bela computer on the instrument, exploring various algorithms that make the instrument alife!
