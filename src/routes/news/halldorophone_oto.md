The halldorophone is a ‘feedback-cello’; a cello-like instrument with built-in loudspeaker and volume controls for each string, allowing any string to self-oscillate in feedback. The design has been developed by Halldór Úlfarsson since 2008, and he kindly loaned an instrument to the University of Leeds for a year.
