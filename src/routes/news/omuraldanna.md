After the talk, Julia Mogensen and Adam Pulz Melbye will perform a piece on feedback string instruments: the halldorophone and the FAAB bass. These instruments are built with a feedback system invented by Halldor Ulfarsson, who will also discuss the technique before the performance. There will be an opportunity to talk about the instruments after the performance too.
