Deadline for applications: April 3rd

Applications are now open for a workshop on the traditional percussive instrument: Txalaparta! The workshop will be held on April 11th from 1 pm to 10 pm. The workshop will be held in the Dynjandi room at LHÍ Skipholti 31. 

The workshop will introduce the percussive techniques used to play the instrument and the possibilities of introducing creative AI technologies developed at the lab. We seek participants of diverse musical and cultural backgrounds, everyone is welcome, but the workshop size will be 18 participants plus workshop leaders. Musical education or experience is a big plus. 

The workshop will culminate with a concert at 18.00 at the end of the workshop day where music from the workshop will be performed.

For those who don't know, the txalaparta is a wooden Basque percussion instrument often used in celebrations. The name of the instrument is believed to refer to “racket”, which relates to the sound of the instrument.
