# Overtone Flute Concert at Mengi

** When: May 9th, 2024 at 8pm **   
** Where: Mengi Óðinsgata 2, 101 Reykjavík **   
** Who: Everyone welcome ** 


A performance of pieces made with overtone flutes built by the composers and performers in an open workshop organised by Jan Hendrickse at the Intelligent instruments Lab.

The oldest musical instruments we know of are bone flutes from ca 40,000 years ago. The flute is an instrument that exists in most cultures and we find them in mythology and fine art in all periods. It is an instrument of the human breath, of the psyche, highly expressive and personal. In this evening of performances we showcase the work of participants in a workshop who have made their own instruments. Many of these have been extended with digital and AI tools to create new hybrid compositions and collaborations. The event will feature members of the Intelligent Instruments Lab as well as the workshop participants. 

Additional performers:

Nicola Privato - live electronics  
Victor Riley Shepardson - live electronics  
Júlía Mogensen - Halldórophone  
Jan Hendrickse - flutes and feedback flute
