Thor Magnusson will give a talk on Creative AI in music for the Nordic Union of Popular Music. 

This will take place in Reykjavik, in the Center Hotel, Laugarvegur, Nov 4th, 2021.


<h2>Music and AI: an Auspicious Relationship?</h2>

Musicians have always applied new technologies for music making. A quick look back in history shows how musical instruments have always incorporated progress in science and engineering. Today we are exploring how AI might be applied in music.

But, as technology, there seems to be something different with AI. It is not a passive technology like a drum stick, a guitar pedal or a digital audio workstation. AI proposes, recommends, directs, and its uses can be from a simple parameter control in mastering to a complete generated composed work. It has an agency beyond earlier technologies.

In this talk, I seek to demystify the role of AI in music, discuss the nature of creative AI, and introduce a grounded view that is far from the popular AI-hype or doomsday prophesies which we often read about. I will also introduce the Intelligent Instruments project, as an example of an approach to AI where we apply the latest technologies in machine learning as a technique in making more interesting and personal musical instruments.
