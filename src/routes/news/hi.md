The Intelligent Instruments project has moved to the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Iceland. The project began its work in 2021 at the Iceland University of the Arts, where we had a wonderful time and established great collaborations. The IUoA will continue to be a partner in the project. 

The revolution that has taken place in creative AI in recent months has completely transformed the research landscape of artificial intelligence. With this development, the project has shifted more towards the fields of humanities and social sciences, and the humanities have now become the arena that best suits the project. Therefore, the project has been placed at the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Iceland, with its location in Veröld - Hús Vigdísar. 

We have had a wonderful time at the Iceland University of the Arts, and it will continue to be a partner in the project.

The project will continue as in the past, for example with [Open Labs](/openlab) with us at 3 PM on Fridays. Everyone welcome, as always!
