Bela recently took an interview with our team members Nicola Privato and Giacomo Lepri about their journey in developing and making of the magnetic instrument, Stacco.
 
Bela is the low-latency processor used in Stacco’s design, providing the real-time responsiveness when moving the magnets on the Stacco interface.

In the interview, Nicola and Giacomo talk about their musical backgrounds, how Stacco came to be, the technology, and how Intelligent Instruments Lab influenced the process.

### Giacomo on sensing the AI with Stacco:

> “Instead of simplifying the AI, we're making its complexity accessible to the senses. It's about using our bodies' own intelligence to grasp something we might not understand analytically. // Our approach is really about embodied understanding. Instead of trying to explain the algorithm in a rational way, we're allowing musicians to interact with it physically. It's almost like training your body to “feel” the algorithm.”

Many thanks to the Bela team for doing this beautiful interview!
