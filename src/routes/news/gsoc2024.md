# Google Summer of Code 2024 Project: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks for Real-Time Interaction

Last year, student Ezra Pierce carried out a Google Summer of Code project mentored by Jack Armitage and Victor Shepardson about machine learning on [Bela.io](https://bela.io).
Ezra's project resulted in a publication at the AI Music Creativity conference 2023 in Brighton, UK: [Bela-IREE: An Approach to Embedded Machine Learning for Real-Time Music Interaction](https://aimc2023.pubpub.org/pub/t2l10z49/).

This year, Jack is partnering up with Dr. Chris Kiefer from the EMUTE Lab to explore real-time embedded AI again, only this time based on the work of Stanford's Felix Peterson on Differentiable Logic Gate Networks.

If you're interesting in applying for this project, read the full project description over at the BeagleBoard forum, and get in touch!
