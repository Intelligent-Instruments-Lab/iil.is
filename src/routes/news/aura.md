# AURA Consert series

This Thursday (Nov,20th), AURA kicks off—a weekly concert series exploring new relationships emerging in music through innovative intelligent system design. AURA is curated by artist–researcher Halla Steinunn Stefánsdóttir on the occasion of the Steina: Playback exhibition at the Reykjavík Art Museum: Hafnarhús.

All three events open the doors to ongoing experiments interconnected with our work at the Intelligent Instruments Lab. The series continues Stefánsdóttir's investigation into how recent developments in artificial intelligence are rapidly generating new musical practices.

Recent findings appear in her article in Frontiers in Computer Science, co-authored with Thor Magnusson. To read, follow this link: https://bit.ly/4p6RXAg
