# IIL at Haizebegi Festival

Victor gave a talk on IIL and the <a href="../research/txalaparta">AI Txalaparta project</a> on the final day of <a href="https://haizebegi.eu/">Haizebegi Festival 2024</a> in the Basque country. It took place in the amazing <a href="https://albaola.org/en/">Albaola facility</a> where they build and sail ships using historical methods.
