This November brings two exciting events on Music and AI. We are presenting lab research at both conferences. 

The first one is in Oslo:

<a href= "https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/news-and-events/events/workshops/2022/embodied-ai/index.html">Embodied Perspectives on Musical AI (EmAI)</a>

In this two-day workshop consisting of keynote speeches, performances, and thematic sessions, we explore musical artificial intelligence's past, present, and future through the lenses of embodied cognition.

<a href= "https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/news-and-events/events/workshops/2022/embodied-ai/p/victor-shepardson.html">Victor Shepardson</a> will present a paper on "Investigating the Lived Experience of Statistical AI with Microphenomenology and Notochord" where he presents his Notochord system for realtime performance with AI.

In Oslo our associate lab members Jon Reus and Steve Symons will also present work, some of which was made in our lab in Iceland. Our collaborator Chris Kiefer will also be there with some exciting work.

The second in Stockholm:

<a href= "https://musaiclab.wordpress.com/musaic-festival-2022/">MUSAiC Festival 2022</a>

Three days of lectures and concerts devoted to the themes of the MUSAiC Project and beyond!

<a href= "http://www.sonicwriting.org">Thor Magnusson</a> will present "Intelligent Instruments in Performance" and give an overview of the work we are doing in the lab.
