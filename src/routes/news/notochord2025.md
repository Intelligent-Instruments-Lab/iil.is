We’re looking for musicians who are interested in trying out a MIDI machine learning model we’ve been working on called [Notochord](/research/notochord). It can play along with musicians in a variety of styles, using internet MIDI data with a cheesy 1990s-2000s MIDI file flavour to it. 

This should be an interesting and fun experience for anyone who A. likes to improvise and B. has some basic keyboard skills. It’s not important to be a highly skilled keyboard player but that’s great too.

Sign-up by filling in [this short form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=Dl_6CRghVkaFKWd-2P2-eEtDJvgjIQRIp2JksWsHYzBURUZKMEVaMEYyT0M0T0hBOEVWQlJYQ0NMMC4u). You will be contacted to schedule a 2-hour session at our lab in the University of Iceland, at your convenience. Sessions will take place from 20-31 May 2025.

This study is about musicians’ lived experience with generative machine learning. Recordings will be made, but not published or used to train AI models without your further consent.
