## Description

Hi we're CJ & Zack and we're gonna take you through a journey of generative music w/ neural synthesis. 

We'll hear how different flavors of neural network architectures (from LSTM to Transformer to Diffusion) make different music. We'll see how it extends musicianship beyond just making songs into making 24/7 livestreams. We'll show you how to train or finetune your own custom models & run them on your own. We'll even show you what it's like collaborating with artists & getting into (and out of) copyright trouble. We'll also hint what capabilities are on the horizon. 

This workshop is suitable for a general audience interested in music, possibly even making music for the first time. But also for the deeply curious we'll dip into the science & tech & are happy to answer more advanced questions.

Finally we introduce "prompt jockeying". It’s DJing but harder. If a DJ must be fluent in their rekordbox collection, a PJ must be fluent in their pytorch model. Prompts can be created live together with the audience — fake artists, genre fusions, rap features & producer collabs that never happened.
