In this workshop, you will gain hands-on experience with the cutting edge of musical instrument design, learning from scratch techniques for real-time audio programming, creative AI for gesture-sound mapping, sonic interaction design, physical instrument craft, and speculative design.

Each day you will receive direct instruction in one of the topics above, using your new skills to rehabilitate waste materials into living musical objects, and to collectively improvise music daily at one of the many unique sites at FÃšSK Gufunes.

We welcome beginners, musicians, makers and everyone in between, and especially those who are not well represented in music technology today. Together we will cultivate a friendly environment where everyone listens to and learns from each other.

<a href="https://ruslfest.is" target="_blank">RUSL</a> is a sustainable design festival focusing on circular thinking and its application within art, design and culture. 
The festival is held within the new creative neighborhood of Gufunes. 
A week-long event with workshops, lectures, exhibitions, dinners and social gatherings. 
Included in your ticket is a workshop, daily lunch & dinner, lectures, events over the week and access to the final party BUXUR.
