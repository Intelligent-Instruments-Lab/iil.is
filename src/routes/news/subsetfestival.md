# Feedback Instruments at the Subset Festival

George Kokkinaris, MIZI, and Thanos Polymeneas Liontiris presented MAZA, on 13th June 2024 at Subset festival, the contemporary music sub-festival of Athens/Epidaurus Festival. It was a specially designed and curated sonic experience commissioned by the Athens/Epidaurus Festival. The new stage of Athens Conservatoire was immersed in a dense sonic atmosphere featuring two amplified double basses, a custom feedback double bass, a digital system of 256 sine waves, and a halldorophone, all diffused through an 8-channel speaker arrangement. The strong amplification of the acoustic instruments combined with the sine waves and the feedback sounds provides a hyperrealistic, immersive sonic experience.
