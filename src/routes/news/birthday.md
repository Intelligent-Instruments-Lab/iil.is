The Intelligent Instruments project is one year old! Time to celebrate all our hard work with fun experimental music by fun experimental friends. The performers in this birthday event are Jonathan Chaim Reus, Marco Donnarumma, Hekla, and Bob Hermit. In addition, artist Sean Patrick O’Brien will set up his audiovisual installation, Fern (2022). 

We invite you to join us for a celebration concert on Thursday, September 1st, starting with an installation by Sean O’Brien at 19:30. Musical performances will start promptly at 20:00. After the concert we will run a panel session where there will be an opportunity to discuss with the artists and explore key concepts of their work.

# Performers

**Marco Donnarumma**

Marco is known for engineering machines and composing sounds to create artworks and performances that can speak critically of ritual, power and technology.

**Hekla**

Hekla is known for her bizarre and unique theremin centred music, adding ghostly piano lines, subtle synth and her own distinctive vocals. She emerges from no particular scene, ascribing to no particular rules.
