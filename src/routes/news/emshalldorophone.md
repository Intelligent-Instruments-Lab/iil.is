# Halldorophone at EMS

Halldor Ulfarsson will be introducing his halldorophone at EMS in Sweden. The instrument has been living there for some years and much used by artists in residence. 

EMS writes:

Meet Halldór Úlfarsson at EMS on Monday 27 May talking halldorophone, his electro acoustic string instrument for feedbacking strings.

Halldór Úlfarsson (1977, IS) an Icelandic artist and designer, educated in Finland and the UK. He lives in Iceland but has a workshop in Athens, Greece, where he has been developing the halldorophone, his electro acoustic string instrument for feedbacking strings.

The talk at EMS will be about taking the halldorophone expressed in a handful of prototypes, through an intense development phase in recent years. Specifically where the idea for the instrument came from, how it has changed and what has become clear its strengths are.

Halldór worked on a prototype of the instrument during a residency at EMS in 2013.

The talk is free, but please confirm that you are coming by sending an e-mail to: info@elektronmusikstudion.se The number of places are limited.
