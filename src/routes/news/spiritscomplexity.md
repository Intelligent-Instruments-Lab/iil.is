WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

A visit from our *Spirits in Complexity* collaborators from the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, Austria. We have planned the following events:


## Concert

In this informal concert at the lovely 12 Tonar record store and pub, work from the two projects "Spirits in Complexity" and "Intelligent Instruments" will be performed. Expect some hauntology, some ghosts, some latent dimensions, some AI spirits!

Participants: Thomas Grill, Miriam Jochmann, Nicola Privato, Victor Shepardson. 

When: August 20th, 5pm.  
<br>
Where: 12 Tónar. Map [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FrRvwRTLTtnD8ig19)  
<br>



## Symposium

The artistic research project “Spirits in Complexity – Making kin with experimental music systems” conducted at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, Austria, explores the functional and affective relationships of humans and technological objects in the context of experimental music-making. The titular term “spirits” is used in a more or less metaphorical sense to refer to an opaque complexity that characterizes human and non-human interaction in the artistic-creative context. In this symposium we will get presentations from the Vienna team as well as presentations from members of the Intelligent Instruments Lab.

When: August 22, 3pm. <br>
Where: Veröld - Hús Vigdísar. Room 103. Map [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YPQ82HxCT5UPurn68) <br>
