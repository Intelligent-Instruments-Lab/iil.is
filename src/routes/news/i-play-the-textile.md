Let's play music with e-textiles! 

Saturday, September 16 2023 at 15:00-17:00 

Girls rock Iceland! / Læti! and Intelligent Instruments Lab invite you to an electro-textile workshop with Sophie Skach.

Textiles equipped with conductive properties can be made into sensors, and even speakers. They are called e-textiles or smart textiles. Whatever you want to call it, in this workshop we get a short introduction to the use of textiles as an instrument. Finally, Sophie will teach us to make a simple sensor of soft material that triggers sound!

Sophie Skach is a postdoctoral researcher in the field of textiles with digital media who currently works as a researcher at the Intelligent Instruments Lab at the Iceland Academy of the Arts and in London.

The workshop is for all marginalized genders; women, trans men and intersex people of all ages!

No knowledge is necessary.
