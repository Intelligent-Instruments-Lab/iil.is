### CHIME

The CHIME network (Computer Human Interaction and Music nEtwork) is an EPSRC-funded research network in Music and Human Computer Interaction which launched in April 2022.
See: <a href="http://www.chime.ac.uk">www.chime.ac.uk</a>

This CHIME symposium will have two presenters: Thor Magnusson from the ii lab and Astrid Bin. Register on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/chime-seminar-sm-astrid-bin-and-thor-magnusson-tickets-672457708107">Eventbrite</a>

<b>Creative Elenctics: Playing with Intelligent Instruments</b>  

Intelligent instruments are a result of how contemporary AI technologies are becoming integral components of our musical ecosystems. The application of creative AI can range from automatic music creation to the embedding of intelligent algorithms in the instrument itself. In this talk I will compare the Socratic elenctics, a philosophical method of inquiry, with the way we engage with modern creative AI systems. Based on experience in practice-based research on creative AI systems, I will present a new mode of exploration and enquiry that emerges when we encounter an intelligent instrument and begin to discover their ergodynamics. The HCI notion of interactivity moves aside for autonomy and a stronger perception of agentical relations through dialogue, probing, curiosity, surprise, alterity and collaboration. When our musical instrument becomes an interlocutor with a strong agency our interaction shifts more to that of prediction, expectation, and confirmation, resulting in a heightened improvisational approaches.

<b>Where few designs have gone before: Lessons in digital instrument design from Star Trek</b>  

In the futuristic universe of Star Trek there are a lot of musical instruments, and many of them using far-future technology. The designers of these instruments never intended them to actually work, and were therefore led by their imaginations and not by the limitations of earthly technology – the opposite of the instrument design process today, where the design process tends to be heavily influenced by the affordances of the technology we have to hand.
In this talk music technology researcher and theorist Astrid Bin explains how she explored this imagination-first process of instrument design by recreating an instrument, as faithfully as possible, from the show. Through the process – from discovering the instrument, to getting input from the show's original production designer, to figuring out how to make the instrument's behaviour true to the original intentions (but using primitive 21st century embedded sensors and computers) – she describes what she learned about designing real digital musical instruments through trying to recreate an imaginary one.
