The Intelligent Instruments Lab at the Iceland University of the Arts, in collaboration with the Department of Comparative Cultural Studies at the University of Iceland, invites applications for a PhD scholarship as part an European Research Council funded project called “Intelligent Instruments: Understanding 21st Century AI Through Creative Music Technologies.” 

We seek applications from highly qualified and motivated people to perform research on musical performance with intelligent instruments. The successful candidate will undertake a 3-year PhD programme working on individual research within the frame of the ERC project. The project explores how artificial intelligence is embedded in musical instruments and conducts a study in the phenomenology of such instruments, the psychology of performing, and how we can foster an understanding of the internals of new intelligent technologies. 

The candidate will have a musical background (formal or not), experience in curating diverse musical events and collaborations, as well as an experience in the analysis and evaluation of musical performance.

The position is for three years and it is expected that the candidate will start on September 1st, 2022.

Director of Studies: Prof. Thor Magnusson.
