The Intelligent Instruments Lab is bringing some of the instruments it has been developing to Mengi for an evening of performative sonic explorations. Short pre-composed pieces are followed by improvised sets in which the players are chosen at random by drawing names out of a hat. Impromptu sets respond to prepared performances, instigating a sonic dialogue in which difference and unpredictability require us to carefully listen to one another. The halldorophone, Stacco, the Living Looper, the Sophtar, the EM Sniffers and more instruments will be played by a rotating group of performers, each bringing a different perspective on what happens when people and their sonic tools find each other on stage.

The Intelligent Instruments Lab (IIL) is an interdisciplinary research lab that investigates the role of artificial intelligence in new musical instruments. Music is our research base, but our methodology is grounded in the experimental humanities. IIL is located at the University of Iceland, where we work on designing, building and testing new instruments in collaboration with other researchers, musicians and artists. We are based in the humanities with access to the universityâ€™s advanced workshops and labs. We seek to maintain a strong public engagement, for example through our Friday Open Labs, symposia and musical events.
