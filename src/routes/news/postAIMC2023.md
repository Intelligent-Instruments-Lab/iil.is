### Reflecting on AIMC 2023

In September 2023 two research labs focussing on musical instruments and live performance came together to run the **International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Music Creativity**, or [AIMC 2023](https://aimc2023.pubpub.org). After our application to the [AI and Music Creativity] (https://aimusiccreativity.org) board, it was decided that we would run the 2023 conference at the University of Sussex with the theme of "Intelligent Performance Systems".

The two labs organising the conference were:
[Experimental Music Technologies Lab](http://www.emutelab.org)
[Intelligent Instruments Lab](http://www.iil.is)

The conference had 75 submissions from all over the world across diverse tracks (papers, demos, doctoral consortium and performances). We also had 14 Alt-AIMC submissions, but the idea with the "Alt" is to allow for late breaking, unfinished or controversial work. 85 people registered to the conference and in addition to the Sussex and Icelandic teams, we were around 100 people participating. 

### Conference format and Proceedings

The conference had two keynotes, paper sessions (5 min lightning talks, followed by poster sessions), performances, workshops, demos and an algorave.
