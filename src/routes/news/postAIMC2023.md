### Reflecting on AIMC 2023

In September 2023 two research labs focussing on musical instruments and live performance came together to run the **International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Music Creativity**, or [AIMC 2023](https://aimc2023.pubpub.org). After our application to the [AI and Music Creativity](https://aimusiccreativity.org) board, it was decided that we would run the 2023 conference at the University of Sussex with the theme of "Intelligent Performance Systems".

The two labs organising the conference were:
[Experimental Music Technologies Lab](http://www.emutelab.org)

[Intelligent Instruments Lab](http://www.iil.is)

The conference had 75 submissions from all over the world across diverse tracks (papers, demos, doctoral consortium and performances). We also had 14 Alt-AIMC submissions, but the idea with the "Alt" is to allow for late breaking, unfinished or controversial work. Those were judged by the jury and not double blind peer-reviewed like the academic papers. 85 people registered to the conference and in addition to the Sussex and Icelandic teams, we were around 100 people participating.

### Conference format and Proceedings

The conference had two keynotes, paper sessions (5 min lightning talks, followed by poster sessions), performances, workshops, demos and an algorave.
