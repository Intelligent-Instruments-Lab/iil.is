# Intelligent Instruments at Arctic Circle

Miguel Angel Crozzoli and Garrison Gerard are presenting their latest collaboration "Sonifying the Arctic" at the Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik. Their work offers an innovative approach to working with field recording data and sensor data from field stations. Through an intelligent harmonization and data imputation system they created Soundprints that can be potentially used for scientific inquiry and artistic expression. 

### Abstract
Combining field recording and sonification techniques offers great potential for aesthetic exploration and data perceptualization. Various artists have explored this combination through their artworks, developing methodologies for artistic creation with different intentsâ€”ranging from scientific inquiry and knowledge dissemination to purely aesthetic affectation. In this project, we explored a combination of methodologies, including the sonification of spectrograms and using weather data to modify granular synthesis parameters affecting samples created from our denoised field recordings. A key feature of this project is the development of a harmonization system that integrates sensor data collected from a field station with event detection, species classifications, and spectrograms derived from field recordings of the areas surrounding the field station. We also implemented an autoencoder architecture for data imputation to address the disparity in data volume and time resolution between both sources. In "Sonifying the Arctic," we developed a method to create an auditory identity for each data point, an approach we termed digital soundprint.
