# Intelligent Instruments at Ars Elecronica

The Intelligent Instruments Lab has been invited to show recent work at the Ars Electronica festival in Linz. Ars Electronica is the largest international festival for art, technology and society which has been running since 1979. It is a gathering of artists, scientists and technologists, focusing on experimentation in contemporary technology and innovation. The role of art as a critical platform investigating technology makes the festival unique in its approaches to the issues of today's society.

The ii lab will be exhibiting instruments as part of the <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/hope/en/">POSTCITY project area exhibition</a>.

Thor Magnusson will also participate in a panel on AI in arts called <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/aeblog/en/2024/08/26/from-hope-to-action/">AI and New Models in Creative Collaboration</a>. 

We have also been awarded a [Prix Ars Electronica](https://calls.ars.electronica.art/2024/prix/winners/14162/)
