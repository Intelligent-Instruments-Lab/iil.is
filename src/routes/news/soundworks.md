Thor Magnusson's text <i>Designing the Threnoscope, or, How I Wrote One of My Pieces</i> has just been published in a new Orpheus Institute Publicaton called <a href="https://orpheusinstituut.be/en/publications/sound-work" target="_blank">Sound Work</a>.

The Threnoscope live coding system started as a musical piece exploring ideas of microtonal music, surround sound, and long duration time frames. During its compositional design process the piece evolved into a live coding performance system, a hybrid of an instrument and a compositional system. The unfolding of the work took place in a context of live performances, audience feedback, user comments, and ideas that developed in concert with how the body of code grew and stabilised.

This chapter introduces the system, the research underpinning it, and describes how the bricoleur approach to programming served as a platform for asking questions that materialised in the engagement with the code, the physical properties of sound, and compositional ideas. The piece is a good example of a practice-based research, involving questions in the fields of music, human-computer interaction, programming language design, and user studies. 

The chapter reflects on the nature of artistic research and how music software development goes hand in hand with music research. I demonstrate how the digital system's requirements for specifications and completeness inevitably forces a strong understanding of the source domain, namely the physical nature of sound. Such musical practice, when expressed through performance or composition, derives from a rigid research process, yet exists separately from it.
