We made loads of great friends this summer and one of them is artist Sean Patrick O'Brien. He's the master of movement via sounds and has been turning a lot of heads with his creative and unique works lately. We feel lucky to have him with us this summer working on many different projects.

# About Sean

I am an artist that believes the universal language of reality is movement, from planets orbiting stars, to sound waves vibrating through the air—everything moves. I studied in the Studio for Interrelated Media at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design where I focused on kinetic and interactive sculptures. Recently, I graduated from LHÍ with a master's in Performing Arts where I explored the performative aspects of experiencing and interacting with art through events and parties.

# About the project

I have been working with the Intelligent Instrument Lab to make physical the vibrations of sound. In our collaboration with this years RUSL fest, we built speakers and instruments from left-over materials and trash. Lately, I have been deconstructing the loudspeaker and handmaking its distinct individual parts which allow you to feel electromagnetic energy as it is being converted into the movement of waves of sound.
