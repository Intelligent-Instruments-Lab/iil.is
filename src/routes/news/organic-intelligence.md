Workshop: 13th-23rd of February 2023  
Concert: 24th of February, Hallgrímskirkja at 18:00  


**A collaboration between the Intelligent Instruments Lab, Áki Ásgeirsson and Hallgrímskirkja**

The Intelligent Instruments Lab at the Iceland University of the Arts invites interested musicians to participate in a workshop where we will explore the use of creative AI technologies to play the [organ](https://listvinafelag.is/en/the-72-stop-klaisorgan/) at Hallgrimskirkja.

We seek participants of diverse musical and cultural backgrounds, everyone is welcome, but the workshop size will be eight participants plus workshop leaders. We hope to have people in the workshop who want to use the organ in novel and unexpected ways, to make new sounds, tell new stories, develop new interfaces, have fun and redefine what organ music is about. [Áki Ásgeirsson](https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/artists/aki-asgeirsson/) will be the workshop leader together with members of the lab.

The workshop will introduce creative AI technologies developed at the lab and people can use our systems such as the Notochord, Agential Scores, Scramble and more to control the organ. These involve AI and ALife, but participants can come up with their own systems too. We will also introduce our Organolib (technical library of sensors and actuators) which can be used to create novel interfaces. No technical skills are required for this workshop. We are hoping for a diverse group of people from all walks of music!

The Hallgrímskirkja Klais organ has 4 keyboards and a pedalboard, 72 voices and 5275 pipes that can all be controlled by a computer via MIDI. The organ is 15 metres high, weighs about 25 tons, and the largest pipes are about 10 metres high.

In the workshop we will learn about how the organ works, both for human players and how the organ's MIDI connection can extend human capabilities, both in terms of performance and composition by using alternative intelligence.

In the workshop we will explore algorithmic music practices in the past, from ancient times to the current day, and move over to contemporary use of machine learning. We will also look at earlier works written for the organ in MIDI form as examples of how it is used. 

<br />

**Application procedure:**  

The workshop is free, but applicants must send in a form (link here!!!!) before 30th of january. Applicants will receive notifications on the 3rd of February.

# Intelligent Instruments Tech

In the workshop participants will be able to use some of the technologies developed in the lab and also make their own. We will support people in their creative ideas. Some of the technologies we might use are here below, but more info can be found on the lab's [research page](https://iil.is/research).

# The Organolib

The [Organolib](https://iil.is/research/organolib) is a library of technical elements that we're currently designing, a tool that helps us understand the role of technology in creative work. It is an experimental system for the assemblage of musical protypes and demos. We use this to quickly generate and explore ideas together with artists and researchers.

# Tölvera

Tölvera is a system that explores the possibilities of entangling the real-time parameters of musical instruments with artificial life (ALife) and other types of simulations. We have used it for our [agential scores](https://iil.is/research/agential-scores) project. Here users can play with the Tölvera ALife library developed at the lab and explore the use of artificial life in musical composition and performance.

# Notochord

The [Notochord](https://iil.is/research/notochord) is a machine learning system for MIDI data which processes each event very quickly, making it a software backbone for building intelligent instruments for realtime performance. It is made for MIDI data: once trained on a corpus of MIDI files, it can generate music, accompaniment, harmonisation, AI improvisation, or weirder forms of MIDI mangling.

<br>


# Scramble

[Scramble](https://iil.is/research/scramble) is a hands-on MIDI tool for aided composition and performance. It analyses MIDI files and generates musical patterns out of them. It also incorporates the real time input from instruments for real-time interaction. Scramble combines melodic and rhythmic models from any number of songs in order to produce unexpected musical outcomes.

# Linnstrument

Linnstrument is a music performance controller with 3D note expression designed by Roger Linn. The grid based MIDI controller, playable with one or two hands, is velocity sensitive, but also senses three dimensions per finger, polyphonically
