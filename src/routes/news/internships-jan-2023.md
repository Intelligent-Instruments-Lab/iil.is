At the Intelligent Instruments Lab, we are seeking two motivated and independent 3rd year students in Computer Science, Electronic Engineering and related subjects, for internships taking place during the Spring 2023 semester. 

We apply artificial intelligence in musical instruments, and our work spans from machine learning to embedded systems to digital signal processing to sensor and actuator design to interaction design and more. We release our instruments as open source, collaborate with local musicians on concerts and albums, and publish peer-reviewed papers in top conferences: https://iil.is/outputs

Through our collaboration with H√ç, you can receive credits for project-based modules, as H√ç computer science student Sigr√≠√∞ur Birna Matth√≠asd√≥ttir did this year working on AI voice synthesis and interactive machine learning: https://iil.is/news/sigga_summer 

If you are not able to take such a module, but are interested in working with us next summer instead, we are open to supporting applications for Rann√≠s Icelandic Student Innovation Fund: https://en.rannis.is/funding/research/icelandic-student-innovation-fund/ 

See for example Robin Morabito, who spent the summer with us designing interactive sonifications of Icelandic seismology data: https://iil.is/news/robin

Below you will find a summary of the two internships (mentor bios and links can be found at iil.is/people), and more information about what it‚Äôs like to work with us. If you would prefer to just have an informal chat with first, or if you have an idea that does not fit in these categories, please reach out to us anyway, as we would love to hear from you üôÇ

## **Working with us**

The perfect candidates for these posts wants to train their skills in electronics or computer science by developing tools for music-making. Our goal is to have a diverse and fun community of people working in our lab. We welcome people of any gender and background: if you feel underrepresented in this field, we are especially interested in working with you. If diversity is a special interest of yours, our Project Manager Esther Thorvalds works with Stelpur Rokka (http://stelpurrokka.is/) and would love to hear from you: esther@lhi.is

Interns will have a desk in our friendly and exciting lab at LH√ç √ûverholt, and can expect weekly supervisions with their primary supervisor, ad-hoc in-person and asynchronous communication and collaboration, and support in submitting final project reports. Those who are interested in publishing their work at a conference with us will also be supported in academic writing and science communication. We offer a fun research and work environment in our lab; we offer guidance and conversations, so you will not have to carry any big responsibilities, but rather work under a set plan we agree on together.

You can also collaborate with us informally and on a voluntary basis, by joining our Open Lab events (https://iil.is/openlab) and forking our repos on GitHub (https://github.com/intelligent-instruments-lab). 

You can also join our Discord (https://discord.gg/fY9GYMebtJ), and keep in touch with us on social media (see footer!).

Please get in touch with us if you have any questions: thor.magnusson@lhi.is
