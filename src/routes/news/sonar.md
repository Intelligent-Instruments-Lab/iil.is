# Intelligent Instruments at Sonar Festival

The Intelligent Instruments Lab has been invited to show recent work at the Sonar 2024 festival in Barcelona. Sonar is a pioneering festival which has reflected the evolution and expansion of electronic music and digital culture since its first edition in 1994. Every year, Sonar converts Barcelona into a focal point for music lovers, artists and professionals from across the world. We at the Intelligent Instruments Lab are exhibiting our work as part of the Sonar+D Project Area, which is full of exciting innovative projects in music technology. 

The ii lab will be part of the <a href="https://sonar.es/en/activity/project-area">AI & Music powered by S+T+ARTS</a> project area exhibition.

Thor Magnusson will also participate in a panel on AI in music called <a href="https://sonar.es/es/actividad/we-are-the-music-makers-ai-and-music-forum">We are the music makers - AI & Music</a>. The panel is with Anna Xambo (C4DM-QMUL), Magda Polo (UB EKHO), Rob Clouth, Sergi Jorda (UPF), and Thor Magnusson (Intelligent Instruments). Moderated by Gunseli Yalcinkaya (Dazed & Confused).
