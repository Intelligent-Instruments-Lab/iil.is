The **first** one is the **European Citizen Science Awards** where the lab won an Honorary Mention. This Citizen Science Award focuses on research projects whose "social and political impact advances the further development of a pluralistic, inclusive and sustainable society in Europe." 

Information on the European Union Prize for Citizen Science awardees can be found <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/citizenscience/en/winners/">here</a>. The European Commission published a <a href="https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/eu-prize-for-citizen-science-2024-announcement-of-winners">webcast</a> announcing the winners.

The Citizen Science jury writes in their general <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/citizenscience/en/jury/">jury statement</a> <b>"Citizen science, a collaborative approach involving volunteers from diverse backgrounds in scientific research, represents a trend and a key paradigm shift in contemporary science. At its core, citizen science embodies the democratisation of knowledge. Inviting participants from all walks of life to participate in scientific discovery transcends traditional boundaries of expertise, inspires curiosity, catalyses innovation across various disciplines, and empowers communities to actively contribute to our understanding of the world."</b> The Intelligent Instruments Lab could not agree more and we thank all the participants in our workshops, experiments, concerts and open labs as they have been invaluable in shaping the research focus of our project.

The **second** prize awarded to the lab is the **Prix Ars Electronica** <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/prix/en/winners/#aiinartaward">AI in Art Award</a> - Award of Distinction. The Prix Ars Electronica is described as "the worldâ€™s longest-running media art competition. With the award-winning works of international artists as a trend barometer, it offers an inspiring, current and forward-looking insight into the interface between art, technology and society."

We will be joining the European Commission and the Prix Ars Electronica at the <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/news/en/">Ars Electronica Festival</a> in Linz in September.
