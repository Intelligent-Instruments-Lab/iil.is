Primary Investigator Thor Magnusson, has been asked on several occasions to present the Intelligent Instruments project in the Icelandic media. These are some of our favourite moments, note that all of the interviews are in Icelandic. 

<h2>An Article in Þræðir</h2>

Atli Ingólfsson, an editor of Þræðir - the research journal of the Iceland University of the Arts Music Department - invited us to write an article on the Intelligent Instruments project.
