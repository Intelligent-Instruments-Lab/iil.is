## Tölvera: Real-Time Interactive Self-Organising Systems for HCI Research & Artistic Practice

In artificial intelligence-based human-computer interaction research, self-organising systems and artificial life offer unique opportunities for creative coding and interaction design that remain underexplored compared to the dominant paradigm of machine learning.
These approaches can yield emergent, dynamic, and open-ended interactions that are difficult to achieve with traditional ML techniques, and at a fraction of the computational cost.

[Tölvera](/research/tolvera), a Python-based medium for creative exploration of self-organising systems, was created to address this gap in the field of music interaction and to support artistic research. 
This tutorial offers an introduction to Tölvera and its myriad features for interaction across sonic, visual and other modalities.

Attendees will gain the practical experience needed to start integrating interactive self-organising systems into their own practices, whether they lie in research, art or both.
Through practical demos and group discussion, attendees will also be invited to contemplate other subfields of artificial intelligence that might be more deserving of attention.

Ahead of the workshop, participants can optionally [install Tölvera](https://intelligent-instruments-lab.github.io/tolvera/#install) and try out the [examples](https://intelligent-instruments-lab.github.io/tolvera/examples/).

## What to bring

- Laptop and charger: macOS with Apple Silicon has the best support, but Linux and Windows are also supported. macOS Intel is not currently supported.
- Headphones
