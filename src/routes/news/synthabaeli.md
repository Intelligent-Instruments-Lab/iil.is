International Synthesizer Day is celebrated each year around the birthday of Robert Moog (May 23rd 1934), the inventor of the first commercial synth. His beloved creation has had such a massive influence across all genres that it would be difficult to imagine modern music without the synthesizer.

In honor of the glorious synthesizer, the downtown Reykjavik City Library will transform its first floor into a fantastic Den of Synth! On Saturday, May 14th, visitors and the curious of all ages can wander among and play with all kinds of magical synthesizers and rare gear that musicians and other synth enthusiasts will have on display. An electronic music wonderland awaits you, and everyone is invited!
