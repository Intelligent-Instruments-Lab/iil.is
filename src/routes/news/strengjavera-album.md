From the press release:

Musician, designer, researcher (formerly IIL postdoc) and PC Music associate [Jack Armitage](http://jackarmitage.com) – whose production credits include Charli XCX and Sigur Rós frontman Jónsi – releases his debut solo album Strengjavera on Iceland's [Mengi Records](http://mengi.net) on September 5, 2025. 

Strengjavera (“string being”) deconstructs and reinterprets the grand piano as a living entity imbued with biologically-inspired intelligences. No human performer is present, no keys are touched, and no harmonic language is enforced. In their absence, a beguiling sonic sculpture unfurls, beckoning the listener in, to intimately witness a meditative commingling of biological simulation and physical reality.

Originally an [installation exhibited at Norræna Húsið](/news/strengjavera-jack-armitage-nordic-house) created using [Tölvera](/research/tolvera), now recorded and arranged over ten tracks, the album carries listeners through evolving states of digital-acoustic interaction. Bird flocking and slime mold algorithms stimulate grand piano strings via electromagnetic fields, and in reciprocity, these algorithms are then subtly perturbed by the piano’s physical resonances. The result is a languid waltz through emergence space, and a novel divergence in contemporary pianism.

With track titles forming a provocative short story by award-winning Icelandic writer María Elísabet Bragadóttir, and stunning artwork from Arna Beth inspired by Octavia E. Butler, the Strengjavera package is completed by a highly limited edition vinyl, pressed by Fish Factory, Creative Center of Stöðvarfjörður, Iceland.

To celebrate, there will be an event at Mengi on Friday 29th August: https://www.facebook.com/events/1308210587375122

In addition, Dagur Kristinn will also present a live debut performance using "rista-vél", an experimental Icelandic programming language developed this summer via a Rannís Student Innovation Fund award. Dagur will give a free workshop about rista-vél at Borgarbókasafnið Grófinni earlier in the day, from 15:00-18:00: https://www.facebook.com/events/690854830664764
