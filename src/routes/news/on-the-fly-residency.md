Lab member Jack Armitage is spending this month in Barcelona taking part in a one month residency:

<a href="https://onthefly.space/" target="_blank">On-the-Fly</a> 
is a project to promote Live Coding practice, a performative technique focused on writing algorithms in real-time so that the one who writes is part of the algorithm. Live coding is mainly used to produce music or images but it extends beyond that. Our objectives are: supporting knowledge exchange between communities, engaging with critical reflections, promoting free and open source tools and approaching live coding to new audiences. The project runs from 10/2020 to 09/2022, is co-founded by the Creative Europe program, and is led by Hangar in collaboration with ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, Ljudmila and Creative Coding Utrecht.

As part of the residency, Jack will be performing at the <a href="https://aaassembly.org" target="_blank">Algorithmic Art Assembly</a> on Saturday 12th March. Full details including lineup, tickets and streaming links can be found here:
