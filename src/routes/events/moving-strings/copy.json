        "In the first international gathering hosted by the newly formed Intelligent Instruments Lab, at the Iceland University of the Arts, we bring together musicians and instrument makers who are using contemporary technologies to rethink how we play strings.",
        "The symposium will focus on how digital processing, including dynamical systems and AI, can augment the nature of the string, a technical element we have used in our instruments for thousands of years. We seek to ask how new digital technologies change our interaction with strings and string instruments in general."

The workshop will be lead by Tinna Þorsteinsdóttir who will introduce you to the instrument and give support, but equally give you time to spend alone with the instrument. People can sign up for the workshop as individuals or groups (e.g. composer-performer duo).",
