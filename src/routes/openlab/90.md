**When: Friday, November 1, 3-5pm**

For this week's Friday Open Lab we invite you to collaborate with us and our neighbour next door, Loftskeytastöðin cultural house on the theme of Morse code!
If you are interested in creating a short Morse code themed piece for the Open mixer performance on the 8th of Nov, come and join us for an open lab workshop on the 1st.

We will start at 3pm in our lab in Veröld, House of Vigdís for discussions with our research team and at 4pm head over to Loftskeytastöðin's event 'Signals and Sounds' where radio amateurs and artists will present on the past and future use of Morse code.

All are welcome! ... . . / -.-- .- .... ---... -.--.-
