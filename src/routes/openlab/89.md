Erik Klinga is a Swedish composer and musician, known from the bands Simian Ghost, Light Vibes and Horse Show. He creates electronic music with an interest in developing works focusing on timbre, melody and harmony in repetition based form structures. Erik practice revoleves around the combination of synthesized sounds and field recordings. 

For our next Open Lab, Erik will set up and demo of his own Buchla instrument, and will discuss his experience working with it in live settings and studio work, focusing in particular on his upcoming release Elusive Shimmer, that he will present next Thursday at [Mengi](https://fb.me/e/hSxKeRuYx).
