Glupsk is an abstract musical trio consisting of Vilhjálmur Yngvi Hjálmasson, Örlygur Steinar Arnalds & Guðmundur Arnalds. All of them have been heavily active in the music scene in Reykjavík being members of other projects such as Tildra, Korter í flog, Slummi, Pellegrina, sideproject, Final Boss Type Zero as well as being members of art collectives and labels such as post-dreifing, Agama, and Mengi. 

Glupsk allows the trio the freedom to explore whatever concepts, genres, or sounds interest them at each moment. However, their main focus lies in improvisation and collaborations with other artists as they make different frameworks and programs for their live sets every time. Glupsk’s instrument of choice is dusty old laptops and esoteric software but they might play instruments on the odd occasion. Their last two albums came out on Mengi Records and show two very different sides of the project. 

The trio just released an album with Icelandic sound and performance artist Sigtryggur Berg Sigmarsson on the Italian label SUPERPANG. They also plan to release a record this year with the sound artist, esoteric synthesizer designer, and Emotional Machine Activator Dalin Waldo based on processed recordings of Dalin’s ENNER synthesiser
