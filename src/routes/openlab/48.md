# Iang

[Julian Scordato](https://www.julianscordato.com/projects.html) is an Italian composer whose practice focuses mainly on sound, graphics, algorithms and interactivity. He is the co-founder of the Arazzi Laptop Ensemble, a group of electroacoustic music performers and composers interested in the interaction between musicians and technology. Since 2020, Julian holds the chair of electroacoustic music composition at the Conservatory of Padua.


In this Open Lab, we will try out Julian's IANG controllers, a system focusing on gesture as a contribution to the intelligibility of the musical discourse and of the performing arts in general. IANG focuses on the movements of the fingers and arms, thus expanding thetraditional concept of musical instrument through the current possibilities offered by IoT technology. By mapping gestural data to control specific parameters of digital sound processing, a close relationship can be established between performer action and audio output.
