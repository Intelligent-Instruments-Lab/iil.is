On Friday the 17th of November we will host our second Open Mixer, at 12 Tónar from 5-7 PM! We encourage our community to join us, grab a drink together and play some music. You can contact Nicola Privato to let us know if you'd like to come with your own instrument or try one of ours that you find particularly interesting, we will reserve a slot for you!

Of course, everyone is welcome to come and have a listen, chat and have some fun. If you're interested in trying out the instruments then please send a message to Nicola and he will get back to you, this will help us plan ahead and organise the jam sessions!
