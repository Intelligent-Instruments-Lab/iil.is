We are taking part in the Iceland University of the Arts annual research conference <a href="https://www.lhi.is/vidburdur/hugarflug-2022">Hugarflug</a>. There will be no open lab this Friday, but we encourage people to come and see the ii lab activities between 10am to 12 o'clock, where we will introduce the lab, demo research and perform. 

The Hugarflug programme is exciting, so we're hoping to see you in the Laugarnes building of LHI.
