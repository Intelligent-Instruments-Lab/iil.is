# Everything Everywhere
For this next open lab Bryan Jacobs will discuss robotic instruments used in his performances Everything Everywhere, Other Mechanized Sound and other compositions.

Everything Everywhere is a one-hour music performance by Ensemble Adapter and Ensemble Pamplemousse, that has been in development since summer 2023. The core members of both groups - Natacha Diels, Bryan Jacobs, Gunnhildur Einarsdóttir and Matthias Engler - act as a creative collective. This evening length multimedia performance combines mechanical instruments, video, story-telling, and musical performance to present an abstract construction of a musical "monster".


### Bryan Jacobs

Composer, performer, and sound artist, Bryan Jacobs’ work focuses on interactions between live performers, mechanical instruments and computers. His pieces are often theatrical in nature, pitting blabber-mouthed fanciful showoffs against timid reluctants. The sounds are playfully organized and many times mimic patterns found in human dialogue. Hand-build electromechanical instruments controlled by microcontrollers bridge acoustic and electroacoutic sound worlds. These instruments live dual lives as time-based concert works and non-time-based gallery works.
