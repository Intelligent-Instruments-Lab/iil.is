# Everything Everywhere

Everything Everywhere is a one-hour music performance by Ensemble Adapter and Ensemble Pamplemousse, that has been in development since summer 2023. The core members of both groups - Natacha Diels, Bryan Jacobs, Gunnhildur Einarsdóttir and Matthias Engler - act as a creative collective. This evening length multimedia performance combines mechanical instruments, video, story-telling, and musical performance to present an abstract construction of a musical "monster".
Bio:
Composer, performer, and sound artist, Bryan Jacobs’ work focuses on interactions between live performers, mechanical instruments and computers. His pieces are often theatrical in nature, pitting blabber-mouthed fanciful showoffs against timid reluctants. The sounds are playfully organized and many times mimic patterns found in human dialogue. Hand-build electromechanical instruments controlled by microcontrollers bridge acoustic and electroacoutic sound worlds. These instruments live dual lives as time-based concert works and non-time-based gallery works.

### Bryan Jacobs

Julie Zhu is a composer, artist, and carillonist. Her work is conceptual and transdisciplinary, operating on an expansive definition of algorithm. Creative and ethical use of AI and machine learning in the arts is one of her research interests as an Assistant Professor in Performing Arts Technology at the University of Michigan.

An advocate for intermedia composition, Zhu collaborates with artists and musicians globally. The results of these collaborations have been exhibited at and performed in studios and residencies throughout Europe, North America, and Asia, but namely Carnegie Hall (NYC), Herbst Theatre (San Francisco), IRCAM (Paris, France), digitIZMir (Izmir, Turkey), Tetramatyka Festival (Lviv, Ukraine), Sansusī (Latvia), Chicago Home Theater Festival, Miami Design District, College Band Director’s National Association, ICMC (Shenzhen, China), among others. Notable commissions came from Radio France, GMEM, San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, and the University of Chicago Carillon.

Many of Zhu’s pieces are characterized by constraints: whether it is putting a percussionist (or herself) in a wooden box, drawing circles that are amplified through a speaker dome, or hiding the harpsichordist and keyboard in a cardboard house with live video, or developing the just-intonated harmonic architecture for the specific rotation, orbit, and angle of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars in a string quartet. For Zhu, art is best as an anonymous gesture and as a trap.

As a carillonist, Zhu regularly performs on the Burton and Lurie Tower at the University of Michigan and concertizes in the summer. During her time as a visual artist in New York City, she was the resident carillonneur at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue.
