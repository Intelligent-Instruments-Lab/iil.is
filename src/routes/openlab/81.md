# Gianluca Elia presents a digitally-controllable no-input mixer

## NOTE: SINCE LAST OPENLAB IIL HAS MOVED TO A NEW LOCATION, SEE LINK BELOW

Marking the beginning of a two-months stay at the Lab, Gianluca Elia will present the current state of his ongoing research on a digitally controllable no-input mixer. No-input mixing is a simple technique that transforms a conventional audio mixer into a self-oscillating sound generator, by feeding its outputs back into its inputs. Characterized by an unpredictable, yet non-arbitrary behavior, the mixer becomes a co-creative partner in music-making, resisting precise autocratic control strategies and offering instead a space for negotiation of musical desires, starting from very raw electronic sounds. Introducing digital control is intended to offer new perspectives on this chaotic space, to temporarily map it, to zoom into its fractal geometries, and perhaps to generate some interesting graphic for awesome tattoos. While we implement mapping and analysis strategies, whether this ends in a miserable attempt to paranoically control something that would be the most joyfully left as it is, or into some new edges for a lovely conversation with the unknown, it's an open question for (at least) the next two months.

And our very own Victor Shepardson will also present his no-input mixer which he performed with at Mengi at the [Overtone Flute Concert](https://iil.is/news/overtoneflutemengi).
