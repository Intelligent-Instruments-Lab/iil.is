# Miguel Crozzoli and Garrison Gerard present their collaboration SONIFYING THE ARCTIC: a Sound Installation employing Ecoacoustics and Data Sonification

Combining field recording and sonification techniques offers great potential for aesthetic exploration and data perceptualization. Various artists have explored this combination through their artworks, developing methodologies for artistic creation with different intents—ranging from scientific inquiry and knowledge dissemination to purely aesthetic affectation. In this project, we explored a combination of methodologies, including the sonification of spectrograms and using weather data to modify granular synthesis parameters affecting samples created from our denoised field recordings. A key feature of this project is the development of a harmonization system integrating sensor data collected from a field station with event detection, classification, and spectrograms derived from field recordings. We also implemented an autoencoder architecture for data imputation to address the disparity in data volume and time resolution between both sources. In ”Sonifying the Arctic,” we developed a method to create an auditory identity for each data point, an approach we termed digital soundprint.
