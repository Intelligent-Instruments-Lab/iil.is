In our first open lab we had a visit from long time collaborators, Þráinn Hjálmarsson and Ingi Garðar Erlendsson. They presented the Thranophone, a feedback tuba instrument. We got a performance by Ingi Garðar leading to an interesting discussion. We also had a presentation by Hjalti, discussing his new metal collaborative sax sculpture/instrument. More about that later.

There is further info on Thranophones [here](http://thrainnhjalmarsson.info/thranophones).
A performance with Eirikur Orri at [2016 Live Interfaces](http://www.liveinterfaces.org/2016) can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/l5vDKEZsJjY?t=718).
