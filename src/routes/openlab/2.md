In this session we had a presentation by Hjalti, discussing his new metal collaborative sax sculpture/instrument. More about that later. 

We then participated in a streamed session organised by the [Feedback Musicianship Network](https://feedback-musicianship.pubpub.org).

Here is a recording of a ive performance by [Ã˜yvind Brandtsegg](https://feedback-musicianship.pubpub.org/pub/events/release/17).
