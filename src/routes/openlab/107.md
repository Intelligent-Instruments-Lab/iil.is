# Sonic Baton V2: Performative Composition and New Material-Ensemble Agentalities in Conducting Practice
This presentation reflects on the evolving trajectory of the Sonic Baton, an artistic research project exploring how conducting can be expanded as a compositional, performative, and materially entangled act. Since its first iteration in 2023, the Sonic Baton has featured in commissioned performances, prestigious venues and international conferences including The Living Art Museum in iceland, Harpa Concert Hall, xCoAx, the 50th International Conductors Guild at the Royal College of Music London, COST Action 23158 on Artistic Intelligence Portugal, and Nordic AI Days. Foundational concepts from the project have been published in Leonardo, xCoAx proceedings, the Iceland University of the Arts journal ÞRÆÐIR, and my Master of Music thesis.
Recently, Sonic Baton Version 2 was redesigned in collaboration with Krisjanis Rijnieks at FabLab Aalto University, Finland. This presentation explores the similarities and differences between the two iterations—focusing on changes in sensors, communication protocols, and fabrication—and previews recent and upcoming performances. These include Spherical Harmonics with Peter Østergaard, May the Whole Universe by Bergþóra Ægisdóttir (with cellist Adele Xiang), and Loxodrome with UKAI Projects.

Looking ahead, the project centers on performative composition, wherein I, as an instrumentalist, perform and record audio datasets using the oboe (in nature) and the Magnetic Resonator Piano, to be trained through the RAVE model. These “dataset albums” become compositional materialities that I use via the Sonic Baton in performance, creating new ensemble agentalities, aesthetics and further expanding the practice of conducting. Future research includes integrating the Sonic Baton with Somax2 for machine-listening, predictive learning improvisation and deepening inquiry into posthuman embodiment and entanglement in the conductor’s performative process.

## Majella Clarke
Majella Clarke (MMus, MBA, MSc) explores the intersection of art, science, and technology through experimental conducting, in addition to traditional orchestral conducting practices. Her research focuses on compositional materiality, the expansion of conducting practice, and aesthetic implications for ensembles and performance. She is also a scientist with experience in teaching and applying AI/ML in both scientific, business and artistic practice. Her latest projects include: Conducting Water (2025–), an experimental exploration of the material agency of water through embodied conducting, using computer vision, multimodal synthesis, and improvisation for new media, composition, sound art, and performance; The Sonic Baton Project (2023-), a gesture-controlled neural audio synthesis tool developed with the Intelligent Instruments Lab Iceland , spanning performances, compositions, sculpture, and dataset albums; and Aromasonics (2025), a system of olfactory notation and aromatic scoring that translates scent properties into musical compositions, premiered on a Magnetic Resonator Piano, integrating improvisation, sound art, and chemical principles.
