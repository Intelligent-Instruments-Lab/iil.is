# Margherita Pevere on her artistic practice

Death, ecology, vulnerability: these ideas are at the heart of Margherita Pevere's artistic practice and research. She hybridizes biotechnology and ecological processes, queer studies studies and environmental humanities to create performances and installation with a distinctive visceral signature.
Her body of work is a blooming garden crawling with genetically edited bacteria, cells, sex hormones, microbial biofilm, blood, slugs, growing plants and burned soil. At the Open Lab, she will present her work and introduce her current project Lament on the ecologies of death after extreme wildfires.
