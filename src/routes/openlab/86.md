[Orion Reed](https://www.orionreed.com) ([X](https://x.com/OrionReedOne)) will share a brief look at how software interfaces constrain our agency, why malleability matters most at the interface layer, an idea about how to change software without permission from Silicon Valley.

"My research investigates the intersection of computing, human-system interfaces, and emancipatory politics. I am interested in the potential of computing as a medium for thought, as a tool for collective action, and as a means of emancipation. My current focus is basic research into the nature of digital organisation, developing theoretical toolkits to improve shared infrastructure, and applying this research to the design of information systems and experiments in human-computer interaction."

[Dan Jones](https://www.erase.net/) will summarise his recent work ahead of his research residency at IIL.

"I am a UK-based artist-researcher, interested in algorithmic composition, sonification, systems music, sound installations, and spatial audio. As part of my practice, I develop a number of [open-source frameworks](https://github.com/ideoforms) that are focused on generating and interacting with sound, primarily via Python."
