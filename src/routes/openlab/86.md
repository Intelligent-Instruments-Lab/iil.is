# Orion Reed on Malleable Interfaces

[Orion Reed](https://www.orionreed.com) ([X](https://x.com/OrionReedOne)) will share a brief look at how software interfaces constrain our agency, why malleability matters most at the interface layer, an idea about how to change software without permission from Silicon Valley.

"My research investigates the intersection of computing, human-system interfaces, and emancipatory politics. I am interested in the potential of computing as a medium for thought, as a tool for collective action, and as a means of emancipation. My current focus is basic research into the nature of digital organisation, developing theoretical toolkits to improve shared infrastructure, and applying this research to the design of information systems and experiments in human-computer interaction."

[Daniel Jones](https://www.danieljohnjones.com/) ([Instagram](https://instagram.com/ideoforms), [X](https://x.com/ideoforms)) is a UK-based artist-researcher whose work explores new ways in which sound and technology can illuminate our understanding of the world, translating patterns and data into living musical forms.
Ahead of his research residency at IIL, Daniel will present an overview of his recent work, spanning topics including forest ecosystems, bacterial dynamics, FM radio broadcasts, weather systems, and hidden network infrastructures.
