ATTENTION: No open lab in our usual space in Þverholt...

We will run the open lab in Skipholt where we have installed the [Magnetic Resonator Piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu6Ty9Kh57M), in the Music Department's Fræðastofa.

You can explore the [Moving Strings Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he4wBSFEl18) from last year.

Please join us if you are interested in this instrument. We are would love to work with you and develop some cool ideas for it.

See you in Fræðastofa at Skipholt 31, 3rd floor, at 3pm.

All welcome as always!
