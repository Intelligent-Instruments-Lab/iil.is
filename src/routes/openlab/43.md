Sophie Skach is a postdoctoral researcher and designer working with electronic textiles. This week's Open Lab will feature some of her work and invites people to touch, interact with, and brainstorm about knitted sensors as soft, wearable instruments.

Spending three months in Iceland at the IIL as a postdoctoral researcher, Sophie is particularly interested in exploring the material properties of knitted surfaces and how that can feed into the design of new musical interfaces.
