100th Open Lab Celebration and Open Mixer at 12 Tónar 🎊

**Where: 12 Tónar (Skólavörðustígur 15, 101 Reykjavík)**

**When: 18:00-20:00, Friday the 21st of March 2025**

**[Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/989395316494064)**

On Friday the 21st of March we will host our hundredth Open Lab and fourth Open Mixer, at 12 Tónar from 6-8 PM! 

We encourage our community to join us, grab a drink together and play some music. Anyone is invited to bring an acoustic instrument or an electric instrument which can plug into a soundboard for an open jam session. Experiments and works in progress especially welcome! We will have some of our own instruments set up to try as well.

Of course, everyone is welcome to come and have a listen, chat and have some fun.
