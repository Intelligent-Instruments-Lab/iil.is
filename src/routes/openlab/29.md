This Friday we will have a visit from luthier <a href="https://hansjohannsson.com">Hans Jóhannsson</a>. 

Hans will discuss his luthiership with us. He has been working with impulse response recordings of various violins and has collaborated on a digital convolution synthesis system that enables one violin to sound like another. Hans gave us a 17th-century style title of his presentation: "On the understanding of bowed string instrument tone through a fusion of traditional tacit empirical methods and scientific epistemic approaches including finite element modelling and experimental modal analysis." Looking forward to that.

Jack will also demo some of the work he has been working on recently which includes the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXavtyyyj34">Keytam drum</a> and the  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDTaH_d8s8c">Magnetic Resonator Piano</a>. (and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu6Ty9Kh57M">here in Icelandic Media)

All welcome, as always!

Þverholt 11, 4th floor, at 3pm!
