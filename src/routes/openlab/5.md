In this open lab we had two presentations by people building loudspeakers. 

<a href="http://joshuawilkinsonsd.com/" target="_blank">Josh Wilkinson</a> offered his "gonzo guide" to building efficient and portable sound systems ready for festivals in the middle of the desert.

<br>

<a href="http://instagram.com/foreverywhere" target="_blank">Sean Patrick O'Brien</a> discussed experiments with building speakers in various sizes and materials.

Josh and Sean also collaborated on building the sound system for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/the.post.house.venue/" target="_blank">Póst-Húsið</a>.
