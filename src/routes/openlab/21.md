In this Open Lab, Björn Þór Jónsson will present his <a href="https://www.synth.is">Synth.is</a> project and the upcoming research he is about to conduct at the <a href="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/">RITMO Centre</a> in Oslo.

Björn has sent us this description:

New sounds can be discovered at <a href="https://www.synth.is">synth.is</a> by evolving populations of pattern producing neural networks (CPPNs) and combining their outputs with audio signal patches, either interactively or automatically.  The sounds discovered by this sound innovation engine can be used in electronic music, gaming experiences or other types of sound design.  Combining computational resources and curation skills to navigate the space of possible sounds, miners can publish their genes to be rendered to a phenotype in the form of sample based instruments.  Sounds can also be interacted with directly by using the embedded live coding support at <a href="https://www.synth.is">synth.is</a>.
