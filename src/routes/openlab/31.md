Instead of Open Lab on Friday we'll host a <a href="/research/livinglooper">Living Looper</a> Workshop for electric guitarists! It actually starts on Thursday at 2pm and continues on Friday at 3pm ... and there are a couple of spots open! The workshop ends with a concert in Mengi on Saturday night, where we showcase the results of the workshop (participation optional). 

The Living Looper substitutes gesture for memory: an assemblage of machine listening and neural synthesis algorithms mutate and refract the sound of the electric guitar. 

It weaves steel guitar strings into a squelching, growling fabric; we will each tug on a thread and see what happens.
