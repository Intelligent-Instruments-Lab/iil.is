# Gianluca Elia is sharing closing thoughts on ANIM at the end of his stay at IIL.

My stay at IIL was delightful, and I used the word "closing" in the title only to be able to contradict it now. I've been rather opening the project. At this openlab I'd like to share what happened, what has and hasn't been worked on, and what inspirations and future directions emerged about sounds, interfaces and processes, regarding the "animated no-input mixer" I'm musicking with.

We can also hands-on try both my mixer and traditional no-input mixing.
