# Open Lab 50

It's hard to believe, but we have reached the milestone of our 50th Open Lab!
Come and celebrate with us as we reflect on the first one and a half years of IIL.

# Blönduós Outcomes

Last week the lab visited Blönduós Textile Center, where Sophie Skach led the team in creating all kinds of interesting etextiles prototypes. Sophie will share more about what they got up to.

# Announcing Open Mixer

Nicola Privato, one of our PhD students, is launching a new event series called Open Mixer.
Open Mixer is in a literal sense a mixing desk that you can come and plug any instrument into.
More broadly, it is a music-focused extension of the Open Lab idea.
Open Mixer will be taking place a few times per month – if you want to participate get in touch, or just show up!
