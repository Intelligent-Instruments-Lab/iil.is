The sonic baton is an intelligent instrument that makes the art of conducting accessible to anyone for a try. Using Artificial Intelligence based on multiple sound data files, the sonic baton provides a variety of sound responses based on the position, speed and direction that the baton moves - just like conducting. The sonic baton is part of a research and performance collaboration between Majella Clarke, conductor and student at the University of the Arts Iceland, with Nicola Privato, Sean Patrick O'Brien and Vicktor Shepardson from the Intelligent Instruments Lab. In this Open Lab Majella will introduce her practice, and three baton prototypes will be available to try.
