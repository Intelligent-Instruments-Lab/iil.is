# "Synthesising self states": training the MRP to play like Arca

This week at Open Lab, Jack and Victor will discuss their Magnetic Resonator Piano installation created for Arca, as part of her multimedia event at Bourse de Commerca, Paris.

From the press release:

> Produced specifically for this space, "The Light Comes in the name of the Voice" begins as a minimal quest for sound transformation. It is first formed between Arca and a magnetic resonated piano -an electronically-augmented acoustic instrument that produces new acoustic sounds from the piano strings, inducing vibrations to create countless crescendos and harmonics, all controlled from the keyboard. **During the daytime, as Arca disappears, the magnetic resonated piano continues to broadcast sound using AI technology trained on Arca's playing created by Jack Armitage and Victor Shepardson at the Intelligent Instruments Lab in Reykjavik, Iceland**. Meanwhile, the museum's basement hosts "Angels" a series of dark and clinical paintings created by Arca between 2019 and 2023, shown to the public for the first time. These paintings represent a single image, a stillness, and the receptacle of different states.
