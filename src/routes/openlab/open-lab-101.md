Thomas Pausz (b. Paris, 1978) is a critical designer, artist, and researcher, currently Assistant Professor at the Iceland University of the Arts.
In his multimodal research and practice, Pausz stages hybrid ecosystems, where technological dispositifs are mis-used to amplify the voices of non-humans and create spaces for affective ecologies. In 2024, Pausz was a fellow at the Stanley Picker Gallery (UK) with the project Haunted Ecologies. In 2023 he was artist-researcher in residence at the Modular Laboratory (FR) with the project Species Without Spaces.
For this open lab, Thomas will present current research and experiments on interspecies cryptography, in the frame of the project Shellreader, that will be exhibited at √Åsmundarsalur in Reykjav√≠k May 2025. Shellreader is a project in collaboration with the Natural History Museum of Iceland, where Icelandic shells are used as potential vessels for transmitting knowledge to future generations.
