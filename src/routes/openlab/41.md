In connection with our [Organic Intelligence workshop](https://iil.is/news/organic-intelligence) we are inviting composer Áki Ásgeirsson to present experimental organ works that have been composed for the amazing [Klais organ](https://listvinafelag.is/en/the-72-stop-klaisorgan/) at Hallgrímskirkja.

Please come and join us for this session and learn about the work we are doing in the workshop, listen to interesting pieces and discuss the instrument with our expert collaborator Áki. 

All welcome to our open labs, as always, at 3pm at Thverholt 11, 4th floor.
