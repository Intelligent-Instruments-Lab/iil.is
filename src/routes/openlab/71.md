# Jack Armitage

## Tölvera at Nordic House

[Jack Armitage](https://jackarmitage.com) has lately been working on [Tölvera](https://tolvera.is), a Python library for working with artificial life and self-organising systems in the context of musical performance. 
On 9-10 December, Jack will open an installation at Nordic House called _Strengjavera_, using the [Magnetic Resonator Piano](https://instrumentslab.org/research/mrp.html) with [Tölvera](https://tolvera.is). 
At this Open Lab, Jack will describe the motivation behind [Tölvera](https://tolvera.is), cover installations and concerts where [Tölvera](https://tolvera.is) has so far been used, including a preview of how work on _Strengjavera_ is going. Jack will also give a live demonstration of the current state of the tool, which is soon to be available as a package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) where it can be installed with `pip install tolvera`.
