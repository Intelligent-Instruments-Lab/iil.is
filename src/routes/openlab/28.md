After some open lab pause, due to Hugarflug, Science Days and Nordic Music Days, we are back in action.

Andy Gracie, a Barcelona based UK artist, will present some of his works from the last 10 years. These works range from real time astrobiology experiments, through machine learning experiments into the aesthetics of disaster, and on to how things come to an end at the extremes of deep time.

Andy develops work based on the premise of scientific experiment – a need to know how things work on both practical and metaphorical levels. From a solid, research based platform, his projects lead us into complex intertwined narratives and open ended questions about the way we believe things to be.

Further information on Andy <a href="https://www.hostprods.net">here</a>. 

Nicola Privato will have given a demo earlier in the day for the Music Department and he might show us some of that in the lab too.

All welcome, as always!

Þverholt 11, 4th floor, at 3pm!
