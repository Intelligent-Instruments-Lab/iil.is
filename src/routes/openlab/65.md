DNA Music (Genatónar) is not just a piece of music, but an audio metaphor that sheds light on the role of particulate nitrogen bases in the genetic material of the human body. The work will be performed on non-traditional instruments that have a great influence on both performance and creativity. The notes of the piece are already determined by genetic information, but arrangements and the performance will be in the hands of the musicians. Before the musicians create the art, the information is only in the form of letters on a piece of paper, and it will be used no more as music than as a recipe for a cake that fills a hungry gourmet's stomach.

In this open lab we will be visited by Robin Morabito, Hrafnkell Örn Guðjónsson (Keli) and Esther Thorvalds, who are currently working on a piece where a mutated BRCA2 gene is the sheet music.

The big question in terms of musical value lies in the mutation itself. Will it be beautiful or ugly? Dissonant or does it jump from one key to another? Will the ear perhaps not notice that something is not as it should be? Just like the cell that doesn't sense the defect in the genetic material and continues to produce useless proteins.

The work is supported by Landsbankinn Grant and Bylgjan's Musician Foundation and will be premiered in early 2024 and published by Intelligent Instruments Records.
