# Nicola

I'm an Italian artist and researcher based in Reykjavik, Iceland. My background is in jazz improvisation, electronic music and linguistics. 
In my practice I like to embrace many different disciplines, such as audiovisual art, data mining, generative scores and AI. 
Throughout the years I've been teaching electronic music, guitar and improvisation, and leading cultural organizations focused in music education and performance.
Currently I'm a researcher at the Intelligent Instruments Lab (Icelandic Univertsity of the Arts) exploring through music practice how artificial intelligence is impacting society, and PhD candidate in Cultural Studies at the University of Iceland.
