Eva Sajovic is a socially engaged artist based in London, whose practice explores the social and technological connotations of textiles. In this Open Lab Eva and Nicola Privato, our PhD student, will present their past collaborations and their work in progress, engaging the visitors in the participative design of an interactive installation. Nicola will also present some of our most recent additions to the Organolib.
