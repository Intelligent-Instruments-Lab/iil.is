In 2021 he graduated from the ArtScience Interfaculty embedded between the Royal Conservatoire and The Royal Academy for Fine Arts in The Hague. Currently he’s composing for the Polish string quartet NeoQuartet, which will premier the composition in Reykjavík in March, during the Icelandic edition of the NeoArte Synthesizer of Arts Festival. 

He will give a presentation of his most recent work (sound installations / performances / instruments) and talk about approaching sound by doing nothing.
