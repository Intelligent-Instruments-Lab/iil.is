Davíð Brynjar will do a short introduction of the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/david-brynjar-franzson/sets/autocoder-examples">Autocoder</a>, a super simple and user friendly AI synthesis tool, followed by a hands on session for anyone who wants to try it out. Bring a soundfile or a song and see what the AI wants to do with it. 

Here is the abstract to the recent ICMC paper he wrote with us in the lab:

We introduce the Autocoder, a simple machine learning tool for spectral synthesis and sound manipulation. The Autocoder is a creative framework that takes a sound –– harmonic or inharmonic, monophonic or polyphonic –– learns its surface features such as harmony, pitch and timbre, and generatively synthesizes a continuous soundscape in real-time, based on the trained model.
