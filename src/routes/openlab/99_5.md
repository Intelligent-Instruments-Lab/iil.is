Mark Hanslip will present his recent solo works which explore the use of RAVE models and of corpus-based granular and concatenative synthesis in live performance.

In one piece, “Runcorn Shopping City”, a RAVE model of solo recordings, trained by residents at the lab, is used to transform a looped phrase; the resulting texture is then further manipulated, resulting in unique, bionic saxophone timbres. Other pieces such as “Flowers” and “PlayTrainPlay” explore the creation of data corpuses and data structures in real time. Passages of improvisation are recorded, filtered, sliced, re-structured and interacted with, resulting in interactions and textures unique to each performance.
Mark Hanslip is an improvising saxophonist and technologist based in northwest England. He earned a PhD in music from the University of York in 2024, exploring deep learning in instrumental practice and improvisation. His work has been presented at AIMC, ISMIR, NIME, and festivals like York Festival of Ideas and Manchester Jazz Festival. Over 20+ years, he has performed with artists including Nate Wooley, Evan Parker, and Mark Sanders. He plays solo, with groups like Revival Room and Kippers, and in various collaborations. Mark also works as a freelance and public sector data scientist.
