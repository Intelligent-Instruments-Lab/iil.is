Michael Danner presents a guitar that uses mechanical feedback to achieve infinite sustain, with the current construction emphasizing lower frequencies. The guitar serves as its own amplifier and speaker, emitting sound at a moderately loud volume. It also features both an output and an input, allowing for external effects loops or the ability to play the guitar as an ordinary guitar, or to use it as an amplifier/speaker combo for another instrument entirely.
