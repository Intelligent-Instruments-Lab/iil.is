Sunna Svavarsdóttir is an artist based in Reykjavík, Iceland. 
In her practice she opens a dialogue on how we navigate the world with our senses; through installations, wearable sculptures or scents.
Her recent works include research regarding kinaesthetic hallucinations and attempts to transfer sound into scents. 

Sunna graduated from ArtScience Interfaculty, Royal Academy of Art & Royal Conservatoire, The Hague in 2019. She has been living and working in Reykjavík since 2021. 

At Open Lab, Sunna will give a brief introduction of her practice and talk about her current projects.
