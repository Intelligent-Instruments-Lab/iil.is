# Adam Pultz and Isabel Bredenbröker  - Queer Sonic Fingerprint

**Where: TBC**

**When: Friday, December 13, 3-5 pm**

The six-channel sound installation Queer Sonic Fingerprint, created by sound artist Adam Pultz and anthropologist Isabel Bredenbröker was recently shown in Berlin. Queer Sonic Fingerprint speculatively imagines non-normative relations around collection artefacts in ethnological museums and beyond. The installation amplifies the collection‘s materiality through the impulse response recordings—or, more poetically, sonic fingerprints—of ethnographic objects. 

In the installation, the fingerprints are subjected to a genetic algorithm that continually produces new generations of fingerprints carrying the acoustic properties of their ancestors. Isabel and Adam will describe the creation of the installation, discuss how sound may elucidate non-normative relations, and talk about why a queerfeminist critique of evolutionary computing is relevant and how it may produce new sonorities.
