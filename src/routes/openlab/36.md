In this open lab, composer Pétur Eggertsson, choreographer Gígja Jónsdóttir, and artist (and our research associate) Sean Patrick O'Brien will present their work for the [Geigengeist](https://id.is/geigengeist-en/), dance show that has been recently premiered in Reykjavik with the Icelandic Dance Company.

From their description:

Geigengeist is a new creation by the techno-violin duo Geigen. The work is made in collaboration with artist Sean Patrick O’Brien and costume designers Tanja Huld Levý & Alexía Rós Gylfadóttir.

At a distant place we meet in a moment in time through the harmony of the violin. In this violin-like dimension, the atmosphere vibrates and the environment is constantly transformed by the rhythmic heartbeat of techno music. The organisms here are interconnected with the forces at work and inspire visitors into the realm of physical expression.

The club is a cosmic violin world in which the visitor enters, travels and participates. Here, the past, future and present meet in an inclusive and free space as a symbol of unity and solidarity as well as individual freedom. Thus, Geigengeist is a proposal for a future social spirit.
