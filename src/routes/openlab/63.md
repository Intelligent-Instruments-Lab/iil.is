# Synthesizers in development

In this open lab we will get a visit from two people who are actively developing new synthesizers and doing interesting research in the field.

# Derek Holzer


Derek Holzer is an audiovisual artist, researcher, lecturer, and electronic instrument creator based in Stockholm. He has performed live, taught workshops and created scores of unique instruments and installations since 2002 across Europe, North and South America, and New Zealand. He is currently a PhD researcher in Media and Interaction Design at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, focusing on historically informed audiovisual synthesis.





# Love Synthesizers

In 2023 Kári founded the company [LOVE Synthesizers](https://www.lovesynthesizers.com) with funding from the Icelandic Technology Development Fund. The purpose is to design and build hardware synths, focusing on an interesting user experience. The work involves the design of electronic parts for production, the design of a physical product and user interface and experience design. The goal is to have a producible and marketable product at the end of the funded time period, around mid-year 2025.
