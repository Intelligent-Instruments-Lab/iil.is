Marco Donnarumma will introduce the XTH Sense (https://marcodonnarumma.com/works/xth-sense/), a biophysical wearable instrument that amplifies sounds from heart, blood and muscles of a performerâ€™s body and uses them to create music, video or light in real-time. It was created by Donnarumma in 2010 and used ever since in all of his works, ranging from biophysical music concerts, actions art pieces, installations and dance-theater productions.

Several papers on the instrument and the practice of biophysical music can be found at this link (https://marcodonnarumma.com/writings/conference-proceedings/)

A performance made exclusively with the XTH Sense can be seen here (https://marcodonnarumma.com/works/ominous/)

The XTH Sense is open source and open hardware, meaning that its software, the hardware documentation and tutorials to make and use the instrument are freely downloadable on-line. The XTH Sense is used by creatives ranging from performing artists and musicians, to researchers in physiotherapy and prosthetics, and universities and students in diverse fields.
