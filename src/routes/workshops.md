### Our Workshop Methodology

One of the research methods we apply in our lab is to test our technologies through workshops. This serves multiple purpose: 

- We prepare our tools for real-world usage, debug, write tutorials and example code.
- We spread our instruments out to users who apply them in their own work and become 'ambassadors' of our systems.
- We gain feedback on the projects as we are developing them and a reality check.
- We explore the perception of AI amongst users, and explore the language and discourse that emerges during the workshop.

# Embedded Sketching for Neural Audio Synthesis

#### TENOR Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, 4 April, 2024.

[Stacco](https://iil.is/research/stacco) is an instrument-score with embedded permanent magnets. It attracts and repels magnetic spheres and detects the changes in its magnetic fields upon interaction. It is designed to perform with neural audio synthesis models, in which sound features are represented and distributed within entangled multidimensional sonic spaces. Stacco allows drawing and embedding scores into the interface itself, and by bridging gesture and notation it overcomes some of the inherent limitations of traditional notational methods as applied to this novel technology. 

In this workshop led by Nicola Privato and Giacomo Lepri, participants were invited to compose and perform sketches for neural synthesis models, by drawing, embedding and layering tracing paper sheets on top of Stacco's surface. The workshop was followed by a discussion on the scores created by the participants and on the affordances of this compositional strategy as applied to neural adusio synthesis.

# Sketching Magnetic Interactions for Neural Synthesis

#### Łódź, Poland, 22 October, 2023.

This workshop focused on [Stacco](https://iil.is/research/stacco), one of the magnetic instruments developed at IIL and specifically designed to perform and compose with Neural Audio Synthesis. The Participants playfully explored neural synthesis models by displacing magnetic spheres on a board with four attractors, using carboard sheets that could be placed on top of the instrument to notate their compositional ideas. 

They sought to answer the question: What gestures, interactions and musical ideas emerge from this intuitive and fun way of composing with Neural Audio Synthesis?

# AI Music Creativity (AIMC) Conference

#### Brighton, UK, 29 August, 2023

We ran the International Conference for AI Music Creativity (AIMC) in August 2023.

The theme of AIMC 2023 was Intelligent Performance Systems, where we were interested in how AI was applied in real-time artistic performance. This included software, physical musical instruments as well as interactive installations. Our focus was on how artists engaged creatively with intelligent objects that contributed to the way we performed and thought music. With this theme we sought artistic and scientific contributions on the topics of creativity, autonomy, authenticity, agency, epistemic tools and human-machine co-creativity. 

How do intelligent tools change the way we think and perform our music? What is the role of intelligent instruments in performance?

# Latent Soundings Workshop

#### LHÍ Laugarnes, Iceland, June 2023

It’s not every day that a new audio synthesis technique emerges. With new machine learning we have the possibility of a neural synthesis! In this introductory workshop we delved into the field of neural audio synthesis. We traced its history interwoven with artificial neural networks and got our hands dirty with training machine learning models with our own sounds. Audio synthesis with neural networks, also known as neural audio synthesis, was a research field within the larger field of AI that facilitated the development of generative sound synthesizers based on the features learned from an original audio corpus. Once ‘trained’, these neural network based synthesizers could generate new sounds which imitated the features and qualities of the original dataset as well as perform timbre transfer—a novel process that reshaped a new audio signal into the timbral qualities of the dataset learned by the algorithm.

# Txalaparta and AI

The txalaparta is a traditional Basque percussion instrument for two performers. It has a unique performance method as it needs two performers to play - its performance is about the commuication between the two players. The instrument is played by hitting wooden batons straight down onto wooden planks (not tuned in any notes) and controlling weight, force and velocity. It is a play between physics and control.

The workshop introduced the percussive techniques used to play the instrument and the possibilities of introducing creative AI technologies developed at the lab. We had been exploring how machine learning models could perform with a human player. The workshop therefore taught the technique and also gave workshop participants the opportunity to play against an AI system (name of your own choosing).

# Organic Intelligence 

#### Intelligent Instruments Lab & Hallgrímskirkja, January 2023

A workshop on the AI control of Hallgrímskirkja's Klais organ. The workshop introduced creative AI technologies developed at the lab and people could use our systems such as the Notochord, Agential Scores, Scramble and more to control the organ. These involved AI and ALife, but participants could come up with their own systems too. We also introduced our Organolib (technical library of sensors and actuators) which could be used to create novel interfaces. No technical skills were required for this workshop. We were hoping for a diverse group of people from all walks of music!

In the workshop we learned about how the organ worked, both for human players and how the organ’s MIDI connection could extend human capabilities, both in terms of performance and composition by using alternative intelligence.

# Living Looper Workshop

#### Intelligent Instruments Lab & Mengi, November 2022

We hosted a Living Looper Workshop for electric guitarists. The Living Looper substitutes gesture for memory: an assemblage of machine listening and neural synthesis algorithms mutate and refract the sound of the electric guitar. It weaves steel guitar strings into a squelching, growling fabric; we will each tug on a thread and see what happens. The workshop ended with a concert in Mengi on Saturday night, where we showcased the results of the workshop.

# Nordic Music Days 

#### Intelligent Instruments Lab, Reykjavík, Iceland, October 2022

In this workshop people of all skills and backgrounds could come and explore the ideas and technologies used to create intelligent musical systems. The workshop focused on music, ideas, performance, expression, and the role of technology in creative work. During these three days we looked at how new musical instruments could change the way we thought about musical practice and made music.

Through looking at new technologies, interfaces and technical elements developed in the lab, we created the conditions for workshop participants to make their own instruments, systems, or compositions. We invited everyone to join the workshop: the only thing you needed was a deep interest in music, musical instruments and how new instruments could be built with contemporary technologies.

# ii lab Workshop at ÓMAR Festival

#### Hjalteyri, Iceland, August 2022

Experimentation in music has always been important to the development of art, media and technology. You can mention how Edison and Bell worked simultaneously on recording technology for sound and telecommunications, or how Teleharmonium was the forerunner of Spotify with streaming music. Back in the centuries, technology can be seen as a tool that changes societies and helps us connect with each other through expression. This has not changed and musicians are still developing new tools, new interfaces and artificial intelligence through new instruments. 

This festival celebrated the role of music at the edge of the possible in technology and examined how disciplines such as music, engineering, psychology, computer science and media science came together to define possible futures.
