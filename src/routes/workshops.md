# AIMC Conference

We ran the International Conference for Music Creativity in August 2023.

The theme of AIMC 2023 was Intelligent Performance Systems, where we were interested in how AI is applied in real-time artistic performance. This includes software, physical musical instruments as well as interactive installations. Our focus is on how artists engage creatively with intelligent objects that contribute to the way we perform and think music. With this theme we seek artistic and scientific contributions on the topics of creativity, autonomy, authenticity, agency, epistemic tools and human-machine co-creativity. How do intelligent tools change the way we think and perform our music? What is the role of intelligent instruments in performance?

# Agential Instruments Design Workshop

Physical and gestural musical instruments that take advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning to explore instrumental agency are becoming more accessible due to the development of new tools and workflows specialised for mobility, portability, efficiency and low latency. This full-day, hands-on workshop will provide all of these tools to participants along with support from their creators, enabling rapid creative exploration of their applications a musical instrument design.

# Live Coding Self-Organising Systems

- *Live Coding Self-Organising Systems*. Jack Armitage. [CuteLab.NYC](https://cutelab.nyc), New York, NY, USA. September 2023.


# Latent Soundings Workshop

It’s not every day that a new audio synthesis technique emerges. With new machine learning we have the possibility of a neural synthesis! In this introductory workshop we’ll be delving into the field of neural audio synthesis. We will trace its history interwoven with artificial neural networks and get our hands dirty with training machine learning models with your own sounds. Audio synthesis with neural networks, also known as neural audio synthesis, is a research field within the larger field of AI that facilitates the development of generative sound synthesizers based on the features learned from an original audio corpus. Once ‘trained’, these neural network based synthesizers can generate new sounds which imitate the features and qualities of the original dataset as well as perform timbre transfer—a novel process that reshapes a new audio signal into the timbral qualities of the dataset learned by the algorithm.

# Txalaparta and AI

The txalaparta is a traditional Basque percussion instrument for two performers. It has a unique performance method as it needs two performers to play - its performance is about the commuication between the two players. The instrument is played by hitting wooden batons straight down onto wooden planks (not tuned in any notes) and controlling weight, force and velocity. It is a play between physics and control.

The workshop will introduce the percussive techniques used to play the instrument and the possibilities of introducing creative AI technologies developed at the lab. We have been exploring how machine learning models can perform with a human player. The workshop will therefore teach the technique and also give workshop participants the opportunity to play against an AI system (name of your own choosing).

# Organic Intelligence 

A workshop on the AI control of Hallgrimskirkja's Klais organ. The workshop introduced creative AI technologies developed at the lab and people can use our systems such as the Notochord, Agential Scores, Scramble and more to control the organ. These involve AI and ALife, but participants can come up with their own systems too. We will also introduce our Organolib (technical library of sensors and actuators) which can be used to create novel interfaces. No technical skills are required for this workshop. We are hoping for a diverse group of people from all walks of music!

In the workshop we will learn about how the organ works, both for human players and how the organ’s MIDI connection can extend human capabilities, both in terms of performance and composition by using alternative intelligence.

# Embedded AI for NIME: Challenges and Opportunities

Workshop run at NIME with two other institutions. 2022.

# Living Algorithms workshop 

at *Raflost festival.* 2022.

# Nordic Music Days 

In this workshop people of all skills and backgrounds can come and explore the ideas and technologies used to create intelligent musical systems. The workshop will focus on music, ideas, performance, expression, and the role of technology in creative work. During these three days we will look at how new musical instruments can change the way we think about musical practice and make music.

Through looking at new technologies, interfaces and technical elements developed in the lab, we create the conditions for workshop participants to make their own instruments, systems, or compositions. We invite everyone to join the workshop: the only thing you need is a deep interest in music, musical instruments and how new instruments can be built with contemporary technologies.
