bio: "I think about what I do as bridges between music and computers: I work with performers, composers and machines to facilitate their relationship to each other, building instruments, interfaces and performance pieces. My work revolves around feedback, both as in Larsen effect and as in human-in-the-loop of a listening-performing process. When I’m lost I ritually play no-input mixer to re-negotiate my agency and musical desire. I’m currently working on a digitally controllable no-input mixer to see if introducing algorithmic strategies can help exploring new grounds for this negotiation, or if it defeats the purpose all together. Other works I’ve done are about the presence of technology in life, such as sonification of WiFi devices' never stopping chit-chat, or computer RAM streams of consciousness. I’m interested in machine learning too, but looking for ways of being critical and perverse with it, rather than an optimistic testimonial, or to say it with Dadabots, to keep it weird. And I play noise. From Spinoza, to Deleuze, to Soren Kjærgaard, to me and you: “we don’t know what a body can do”."
