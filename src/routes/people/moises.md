bio: "As a self-taught sound artist and creative technologist from Tijuana, now based in Berlin, I navigate the realms of computer music, AI, and the politics of emerging digital technologies. My work, presented in spaces such as Ars Electronica and MUTEK, bridges ancient and modern sonic technologies and has earned me the A.I. Newcomer 2023 award. I lead workshops in creative AI, focusing on sound and image synthesis and the demystification of neural networks. Current projects include SEMILLA A.I., an interface for generative neural sound synthesizers, and OIR, an online platform for a semi-autonomous meta-DJ trained on extensive electronic music visuals."
