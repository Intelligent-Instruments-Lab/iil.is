bio: "I'm a composer and artist exploring the intricate relationship between humans and technology. Through my audiovisual creations, I delve into how our interactions with fabricated environments shape our experiences. My works challenge the conventional understanding of how we perceive and engage with technology-infused spaces, I aim to disrupt our habitual consumption of these spaces and interactions, prompting us to venture beyond our comfort zones and actively explore new possibilities. Currently I am focusing on my Fast Forward Trajectory, supported by the Performing Arts Fund NL, which enables me to work with renowned international partners such as Percussions de Strasbourg and the IIL. This collaboration allows me to build valuable new bridges between bits and atoms, deepening the relationship between the human and the algorithmic by bringing together musicians and artificial performers on stage."
