bio: "I build digital instruments, play with them and try to critically think through them. My research crosses the domains of electroacoustic improvisation / composition, human-computer interaction and cultural studies. In short, I am specialised in not being specialised. I hold a master in "Instruments and Interfaces" from STEIM / Institute of Sonology and a PhD in Media and Art Technology from Queen Mary University of London. At IIL I explore compositional strategies for the mediation of sociocultural values and technological agencies, considering the practice of sonic interaction design as an opportunity to play with illusions and magic."
