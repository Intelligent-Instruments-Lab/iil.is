bio: " I am a Berlin-based poet, musician, and artist who performs internationally (e.g. Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Palais de Tokyo, Seo-Seoul Museum of Art) and has found a second home in Reykjavík. Art, for me, is an ancient utopian technology for creating community, possibility, and transformation. During my time at the lab, I am continuing my auto-ethnographic engagement Lava. Rituale — a sensually immersive triptych deeply rooted in Icelandic ecosystems, comprising a poetry collection (kookbooks, 2023), a sound and video installation (Akademie der Künste, 2022), and an interspecies concert performance to be premiered at Ólafur Elíasson’s Festival of Future Nows at the Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin. In collaboration with Nicola Privato, Victor Shepardson, more-than-human agents such as lava rock, kría, and Arctic fox, sound virtuoso Robert Lippok, and infrasound artist Louis Clarke, I explore musical rituals of planetary transition — where haunting, sensual poems from a potential future echo back into the present, inviting us to sense and begin shaping this more tender, sustainable, queer, and peaceful world through our actions today."
