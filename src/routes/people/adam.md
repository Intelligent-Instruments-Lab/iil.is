bio: "I am a performer, composer, and sonic researcher. I create solo double bass music, often with the FAAB (feedback-actuated augmented bass)—a feedback double bass with embedded signal processing. I am fascinated by instruments that exhibit some sense of autonomy and afford interaction and improvisation. In this context, I investigate how terms such as musical mastery, virtuosity, resistance, and failure may become reframed (or rendered obsolete) through the decentrering of human agency, as we engage with machines that don’t always do what we expect them to. I make sound installations, create and exhibit 3D-printed sculptures generated from live music performance, and have created sound for theatre, dance, film, and image. My work has been performed in the US, Japan, Australia and Europe and I appear on around 50 releases, three of these solo albums. I am currently undertaking a PhD in music at SARC (Sonic Arts Research Centre), Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland."
