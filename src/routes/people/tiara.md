bio: "Dr. Roxanne is a scholar and performance artist whose work rethinks the ethics of AI through an anticolonial, eco-feminist, and cyberfeminist lens. Their research critiques how digital technologies rely on the extraction of resources from Indigenous lands and examines how these infrastructures carry colonial legacies inscribed in land, bodies, and memory. They are the author of the forthcoming book with University of California Press (2026), which develops their concepts of digital attunement and the technological haunt.

Tiara has presented at ARS Electronica (Linz), Images Festival (Toronto), Squeaky Wheel Film and Media Art Center (NY), Trinity Square Video (Toronto),  Leuphana University (Lüneberg), European Media Art Festival (Osnabrück), University of Applied Arts (Vienna),  SOAS (London), SLU (Madrid), Transmediale (Berlin), Duke University (NC), Cambridge University (UK), among others."
