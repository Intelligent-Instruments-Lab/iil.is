bio: "I am a homeostatic animal experimenting within a vibrant ecosystem of cultures and tools. I co-founded the instrumentinventorsinitiative (iii) and Platform for Thought in Motion in The Hague, and worked for many years on artist-led research at the former Studio for Electro-Instrumental Music (STEIM). I am currently exploring what it means to have a voice."
