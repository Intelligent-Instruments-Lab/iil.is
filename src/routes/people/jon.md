bio: "I am a research-composer with a fundamentally interdisciplinary approach cutting across music, visual art, natural sciences, education and digital culture. My performance and online works are characterised by hands-on experimentation, hybrid-thinking, and consideration for the material conditions and surroundings in which music, technologies, and knowledges are created.

I am a founder and member of the non-profit cultural initiative iii in the Hague, and co-founder of The Platform for Thought in Motion. In 2016, I received the teaching prize for cross-disciplinary education at the Leuphana University in Lüneburg, Germany where I was associate lecturer of Computing and Coded Culture and helped design the Digital Media Bachelors program. I've received commissions as a composer and artist from Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, CTM Festival Berlin, Slagwerk Den Haag, and Asko-Schönberg Ensemble, including composing original music and devising a complex theatrical instrument of reel-to-reel tape machines and audio routing system performed by live coding for Brave New World 2.0, a nationally-touring ensemble production. I was able to begin this journey thanks to the generous support of a W. J. Fulbright Fellowship for my work into artist-led development of electronic music instruments at the former Studio for Electro-Instrumental Music (STEIM) in Amsterdam."
