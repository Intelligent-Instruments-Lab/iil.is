bio: "I'm a transmedia designer-researcher working globally to explore how systems make worlds. My practice asks how technological innovation can invite more-than-human networks (animal, vegetal, machine, and algorithmic) to walk together across new terrains. I direct the critical design studio We&Us, which since 2020 has explored co-creation for systems change across Europe, Asia & Canada. At IIL, I'll be exploring the lab itself as a living, breathing more-than-human instrument. From autumn 2024, I will be Professor of Transversal Design at IDXM (Institute Experimental Design & Media Cultures), FHNW Academy of Art and Design Basel. Photo credit: Jessica Jacobson."
