bio: "I am a speculative designer (MA RCA) and doctoral researcher at the Intelligent Instruments Lab. My interests span more-than-human ecologies, interspecies media and ecofiction. In my doctoral project, I am designing and testing multimodal dispositifs of co-sensing and co-creating with non-human agencies, and exploring the philosophy and ethics of our mediated relations with the environment. In 2024 I received the Stanley Picker Fellowship (UK) for the exhibition project Haunted Ecologies; in 2022-24 I was an artist-researcher in Residence at the Modular Laboratory at ESAM Caen (FR) for the project Species Without Spaces; In 2025, I became a Professor in Design at the Iceland University of the Arts.
