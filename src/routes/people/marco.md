bio: "I am an artist, performer, stage director and scholar weaving together contemporary performance, new media art and interactive computer music since the early 2000s. My artistic and scholarly work is rooted in feminist theories, critical theory and critical disability studies. I manipulate bodies, create choreographies, engineer machines and compose sounds to create artworks and performances that can speak critically of ritual, power and technology. I have a Ph.D. in performing arts, computing and body theory from Goldsmiths, University of London. Recently, I held Research Fellowships at the Dortmund Academy for Theater and Digitality and at the Berlin University of the Arts - in collaboration with the Neurorobotics Research Laboratory, in Germany. I am a co-founder of the artist group Fronte Vacuo, based in Berlin. Photo cred: Dario J Lagana' | Norte.it"
