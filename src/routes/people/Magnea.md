bio: " I am a master's student in philosophy at the University of Iceland. My work to date has focused on materiality, with particular attention to agency, sense, and the ways material relations shape experience and perception. My research draws on posthumanist theory and engages with contemporary debates in ontology, with a growing interest in the ethical dimensions of material relations."
