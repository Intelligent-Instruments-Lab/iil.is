bio: "I currently study vocal arts at Söngskólinn í Reykjavík and computer science at the University of Iceland. Previously I studied fashion design at Studio Berçot in Paris, and MA Design at Iceland University of the Arts. In my work I am continuously interested in the relationship between the concept of identity and technology. My previous work addresses the ways in which we attempt to upload our physical selves into the virtual world, virtual and digital fashion, augmented reality experiments and machine learning experiments. In collaboration with IIL I am currently working on an AI Vocal Avatar, where I attempt to donate my voice to a machine learning algorithm, and therefore outsourcing my physical body for the process of singing."
