bio: "I’m a research professor at the University of Iceland and a professor of future music in the Music Department at the University of Sussex. I’ve recently served as an Edgard-Varèse guest professor at the Technische Universität Berlin. My research interests include musical performance, improvisation, new technologies for musical expression, live coding, musical notation, artificial intelligence and computational creativity. My research has roots equally in practice and theory and recent books include _Sonic Writing: Technologies of Material, Symbolic and Signal Inscription_ and _Live Coding: A User's Manual_, published by Bloomsbury Academic and MIT Press respectively."
