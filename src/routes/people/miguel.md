bio: "I am a composer, saxophonist, and Ph.D. candidate in Cultural Studies, currently conducting my research project at the Intelligent Instruments Lab in Reykjavik. I have studied European composition, jazz studies, and cultural management in Argentina, and I hold an Advanced Postgraduate Diploma and a master's degree from the Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen, where I conducted practice-based research on the aesthetic potential of sonifications. I believe in the power of sound as a transformative experience for societies, and I am particularly interested in data democratization and knowledge dissemination. Through my research interest in music, new technologies, data, and AI, I explore the questions about the role of the arts in critical thinking and perception."
