bio: "I’m a master’s student in philosophy at the University of Iceland, where I also earned my BA in the same field. My work is driven by questions about climate change, environmental ethics, and how we relate to nature in an increasingly technological world.
At IIL, I’m researching AI-driven dark sonification as a way to make environmental data more perceptible and relational. Through ethnography, experiments, and philosophical analysis, I’m exploring how sound can shift our understanding of climate change and our place within it, in an effort to cultivate care through deeper, more embodied forms of awareness."
