bio: "I work as an artist in socially engaged art practice and a Senior Lecturer at Camberwell College of Art, University of the Arts London. My work deals with colonisation of space and resource caused by gentrification, poverty, human trafficking, and climate change. Early projects included work with women in prison, Gypsy and Traveling communities, homeless people and those being displaced from the Elephant & Castle in London. Since 2016 I have been focusing on projects that confront the climate emergency, using participatory and collaborative methodologies to move people beyond passive spectatorship towards active social agency. Currently my main mediums are knitting & weaving, which I conceptualize as ethical photography (for their binary, time-based qualities, and dependance on plant-based photosynthesis as primary source of “writing with light”). Since there is no route back to the pre-industrial age we will need technology to meet the needs of humanity, I am exploring e-textiles as a synthesis of craft skills with the modern technology."
