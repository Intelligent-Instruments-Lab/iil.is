bio: "I am a UK-based artist-researcher whose work explores new ways in which sound and technology can illuminate our understanding of the world, translating patterns and data into living musical forms. My research interests include algorithmic composition, systems music, spatial audio and sonification. As one half of Jones/Bulley, I am director of a practice-led research studio, creating sculptural sound installations that articulate the hidden dynamics of environmental systems, with past projects portraying forest ecosystems, weather patterns, global audio ecologies, and FM radio transmissions. In my solo practice, I explore the integration of dynamical systems and elemental forces as active agents in musical co-creation. From 2020-2024, I was research leader and co-founder at Sonos Advanced Technology London, a research laboratory that incubates next-generation audio technologies. I hold a PhD in artificial life from Goldsmiths, University of London."
