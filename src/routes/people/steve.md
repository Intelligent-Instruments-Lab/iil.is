bio: "I make interactive sound systems and instruments that I improvise with or exhibit for the public to play. I'm currently a music technology doctoral researcher at the Leverhulme Trust funded be.AI Centre (University of Sussex, Brighton, UK). My research explores enactive metaphors for collaborative musical instruments that enhance intra-dependant actions between human and non-human agents."
