bio: "I hold a BA in Product Design from the Icelandic University of the Arts (2023) and a diploma in web design. I opt for working close to people, hands-on. My interest in human/ material connections has led to my previous and ongoing projects. In collaboration with the Textile lab in Blönduós I researched unused Icelandic materials, secondary wool, and horse hair for possible use as natural upholstery material. Looking into old methods using new material combinations and machinery. Currently, I am focusing on getting to know the “Icelandic” material, aluminum and working hands on with the positive recycling properties of the material on a small scale. Reshaping it into new forms and objects using sand casting methods."
