bio: "As a saxophonist, composer and audio-visual artist I explore the interplay between humans and machines by combining improvisation with generative algorithms, machine learning, brain-computer interfaces and sonification of bio-signals. My current work focuses on real-time sonification and visualisation of EEG and ECG data in a live-performance context, creating a feedback-loop between musicians, machines and sound. In the context of interactive audio-visual installations these systems allow the audience-members to intuitively explore the effects of this feedback-loop on themselves."
