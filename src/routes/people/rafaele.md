bio: "I am a creative musician in the field of applied experimental music. I have studied Conducting, Composition, Production, Cello, Programming, 3D printing and Sonology at Brazil, Germany and the Netherlands. In my research I develop artworks merging those practices with technology, social inclusion, sustainability & fair music distribution. I am a member of Netherlands coding Live, Instrument inventors initiative and the creator of Knurl, an interactive and polyphonic instrument. In the first months in iil, I will be consolidating the interface of Knurl by the asssitance of Thor and Halldor and the collective practice of local musicians. In the third month, Adam Pultz and I are going to be developing and testing our performance "Sound energy harvest", where our instruments sounds are going to be harvesting energy for its own application."
