bio: "I compose music and code, sometimes before execution and sometimes during. My research interests include the design of languages, environments, and interfaces for composing and performing music with computational, generative, or procedural aspects, while my artistic practice includes algorithmic composition, instrumental improvisation, and live coding. Previously, I studied electrical engineering, computer science, and music at MIT, where I earned a BSc and MEng and helped found the MIT Laptop Ensemble. Currently, I'm a PhD student in Music Technology at Georgia Tech in the Computational Music for All lab."
