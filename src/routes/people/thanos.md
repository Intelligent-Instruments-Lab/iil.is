bio: "I am a postdoctoral researcher at Intelligent Instruments Lab. I am a composer, performer, and sound artist. My research interests deal with different manifestations of feedback processes (i.e., audio feedback, data feedback, interpersonal and behavioural feedback). I did my PhD at the University of Sussex, where I explored cybernetic theory principles to devise generative Music Theatre performances. In my previous research I approached the performance space as the interface for interaction, looking into the notion of space as an instrument. Currently at the lab, I am working with feedback acoustic string instruments (feedback double bass, and halldorophone). I am interested in the musical possibilities these instruments offer and in the conceptual frontiers they push in different contexts and setups (solo, ensemble, interlinked etc)."
