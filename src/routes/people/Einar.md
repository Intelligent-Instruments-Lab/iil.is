bio: " I am a composer and organist. I hold an MA degree in sociology from the University of Iceland where my final thesis was a Weberian analysis of generative music. I'm currently pursuing a B.Sc. in computer science at the University of Iceland with an emphasis on data science and artificial intelligence as a precursor for further studies in computational sociology. I am interested in the social ontology of musical forms, how music is socially constructed but materially stabilized through technology, and identifying the social mechanisms involved in generating musical practice."
