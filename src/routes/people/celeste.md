bio: "I am mostly an enthusiastic dancer and live coder/musician but also a digital artist and researcher from Medellin, Colombia, where I worked in many collaborations, album recordings, and live sessions; also I have worked as a software developer for Chmusick toolkit, a library to make ChucK language an algorave language. I am the author of CQenze, a DSL designed to be a first-experience language for non-coders. Also, I developed CineVivo, a graphics render engine.
