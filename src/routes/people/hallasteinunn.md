bio: "I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Intelligent Instruments Lab and active as a performer, composer and curator within contemporary music and ecological sound art. I obtained my PhD in artistic research in music from Lund University. My research looked at agencies at play in artistic processes, explored through micro-labs set within and outside of institutional environments. I continue along such a context-sensitive trajectory at the lab, focusing on the mediation that occurs in the performance of pre-existing design and the prototyping of an AI-augmented violin. "
