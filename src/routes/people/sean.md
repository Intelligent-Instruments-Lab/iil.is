bio: "I have a BFA from the Studio of Interrelated Media from MassArt in Boston and recently received a Master's in Performing Arts from Listaháskóli Íslands where I focused on bringing my background in interactive and kinetic sculpture into a performative and socially engaged practice. Inspired by the local Icelandic arts and music scene and I have worked with the Reykavík Dance Festival, Sequences Art Festival, Nylistasafnið, Kling og Bang, Listahátið, Raflost, Rask, Mengi, Spectral Assault Records, and grassroots organizations Post-Dreifing, RUSL Fest, Fúsk, and King og Bong. My primary goal as an artist is to create an engaging experience that encourages interaction through the performative nature of objects and the sensation of experience."
