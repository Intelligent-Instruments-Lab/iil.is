bio: "I teach Fine Arts at the UPV/EHU University in Bilbao where I did my doctoral thesis on generative music and the txalaparta. I studied Art in Bilbao and MA Design for Interactive Media in London. I am part of www.ixi-audio.net since 2001 and I like developing software to make weird music. I am interested in that place where popular music, contemporary music, art and the creative use of technology meet."
