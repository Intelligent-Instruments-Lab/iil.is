bio: "I am interested in the interplay between human and non-human agencies in music, embodiment in networked music performance, and interactive machine learning. I have recently designed a networkable feedback string instrument with embedded machine learning called the [Sophtar](/research/sophtar). At IIL I am working on extending the Sophtar with actuators and machine learning models to make it respond to my playing in ways that are not easy to predict yet meaningful and inspiring. I see the research and development work on the Sophtar as a way to probe broader research questions on musical improvisation and co-creativity with machines and algorithms."
