bio: "I am a machine learning engineer with experience researching, developing, and productionizing machine learning systems. My interest in music technology was sparked by my time working as an undergraduate researcher with the Robotic Musicianship group at the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology, under Prof. Gil Weinberg. I am particularly interested in creative AI development and applications, and in creating new musical instruments, interfaces, and interactions."
