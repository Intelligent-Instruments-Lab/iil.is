bio: "I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary University of London, where I also obtained my PhD as part of the Media & Arts Technology programme. Trained as a fashion designer (BA, MA), I have worked in industry for larger companies as well as on my own projects. With this background in fashion and textile design, my research explores 'smart' clothing as a ubiquitous, wearable sensing system for applications in social interaction, soft robotics, and intelligent instruments."
