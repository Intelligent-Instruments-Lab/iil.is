The Intelligent Instruments Lab is open for collaborations with artists and scientists on experimental projects, equally as part of our work programme and as collaborations with other projects. We have developed a Collaboration Interaction Protocol (CIP) that makes such collaborations streamlined, easy to set up and effective. It defines all roles, timescales, experimental setups and outcomes through a simple system and we would love to hear from you if you have a reason to believe that our interests might intersect.

We also have a visiting researcher scheme. We welcome people to come and work with us in our Reykjavik lab over a specified period of time. The aim with this scheme is to enable artists, composers and musicians to develop technologies for their musical expression, but in turn the collaboration will help us to answer our research questions. 

Please get in touch with the Principal Investigator, prof Thor Magnusson, or the relevant lab members, and the relevant contact information can be found on his LHI profile.

We also have a public channel on Discord for any questions or conversation
