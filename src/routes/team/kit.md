bio: "I'm a digital anthropologist and artist-designer whose work explores how we navigate culture, identity and belonging across virtual and physical terrains. I am a Director of Studio We & Us, which helps civil society orgs foster sustainable development through creative participation, and a Senior Researcher with Habitat Unit at Technische Universit√§t Berlin. I have lead co-design programmes at organisations like Mozilla and the Open Knowledge Foundation, and conducted ethnographic fieldwork on commoning, open source cultures, creative spaces and multispecies ethics of care across Asia, Europe & Canada. I have a PhD in Media & Cultural Studies from University of Sussex for 'Hacking the Museum', a study of the UK's first museum makerspaces at Tate, British Museum and Wellcome Collection."
