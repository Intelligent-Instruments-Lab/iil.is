bio: "Victor Shepardson is definitely some sort of technologist and arguably some sort of artist. He is broadly interested in electronic music, digital art and machine intelligence. He has generalist programming and audio skills and knows too much about certain neural network models of sound. Victor can often be found fiddling with generative software systems, taking up the technical end of collaborative projects, musicking, and reading research papers. His current project involves building an AI augmented looping instrument and asking what AI means to people, anyway. Victor holds a B.A. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia and and M.A. in Digital Musics from Dartmouth College, and is currently pursuing a doctorate in the Intelligent Instruments Lab at the Iceland University of the Arts. He is from the Washington, DC area and currently lives in Reykjav√≠k."
