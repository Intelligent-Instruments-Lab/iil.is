bio: "I am the inventor of the halldorophone, an electro acoustic string instrument intended for working with string based feedback. For the past decade I have been seeking out and working with musicians to make music with halldorophones and noting their thoughts and feelings on the process to inform further development. I am currently working on a PhD documenting and expanding on this work under the supervision of Thor Magnusson and Chris Kiefer at the University of Sussex. Besides working on this project I am currently funded by an innovation grant from the Icelandic Technology Development Fund on further development of halldorophones. I enjoy using my skills as a fabricator to collaborate with musicians and instrument makers in the NIME context."
