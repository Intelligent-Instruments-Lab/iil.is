## **Short Description**

The Intelligent Instruments Lab is an interdisciplinary research lab that investigates the role of artificial intelligence in new musical instruments. Music is our research base, but the reach and impact is wider and we explore how musical interfaces can be applied as scientific instruments, for example through sonification.

We study creative AI from a broad humanities basis, involving musicians, computer scientists, philosophers and cognitive scientists in key international institutions. We explore the emerging language and discourse of creative AI, addressing how notions such as agency, autonomy, authenticity, authorship, creativity and originality change with these new technologies.
