We have developed the Collaboration Interface Protocol in order to work with other scientists and artists. Some of these collaborations are formal and focussing on specific experiments or projects, but we are also interested in a more open approach and informal exchange and collaboration. 
 
We seek to  maintain a critical yet playful reflection upon the lab as a performative space, where various agents interact and produce knowledge: an “aesthetics of experimentation”.  We will run open lab sessions on Friday afternoons and people can follow the project via public events. We will make regular use of social media, and use podcasts, YouTube and blogging for lasting online documentation.
