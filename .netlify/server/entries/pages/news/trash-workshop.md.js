<p>First off, the workshop is designed to support individual needs and interests. We welcome people who want to learn something new and also people who already have something in mind they want to build. </p>
<p>If you want to learn how to build your very own instrument, using \u201Ctrash\u201D, then this is the workshop for you. Everyone learns on their own pace and due to the vast experience of our workshop leaders, you can decide to learn new skills in the process. You don\u2019t have to learn everything, just find the thing that interests you the most and build from there!</p>

<p>Furthermore, the festival provides vegan food for lunch and dinner each day of the workshop so you won\u2019t go hungry! </p>
<p>To bring discarded materials to life, participants will use a kit loaned by the Intelligent Instruments Lab for the duration of the workshop. Central to this kit is the Bela high performance interactive audio and sensor platform (<a href="${"http://bela.io/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">http://bela.io/</a>). The kit also includes various sensors and actuators allowing participants\u2019 creations to perceive motion, vibration and light, and in turn vibrate and resonate objects and materials of choice.</p>
