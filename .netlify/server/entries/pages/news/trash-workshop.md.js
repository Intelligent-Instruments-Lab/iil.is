<p>First off, the workshop is designed to support individual needs and interests. We welcome people who want to learn something new and also people who already have something in mind they want to build. </p>
<p>If you want to learn how to build your very own instrument, using \u201Ctrash\u201D, then this is the workshop for you. Everyone learns on their own pace and due to the vast experience of our workshop leaders, you can decide to learn new skills in the process. You don\u2019t have to learn everything, just find the thing that interests you the most and build from there!</p>
