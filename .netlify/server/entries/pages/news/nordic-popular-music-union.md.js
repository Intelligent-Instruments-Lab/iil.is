<p>This will take place in Reykjavik, in the Center Hotel, Laugarvegur, Nov 4th, 2021.</p>
<h2>Music and AI: an Auspicious Relationship?</h2>
<p>Musicians have always applied new technologies for music making. A quick look back in history shows how musical instruments have always incorporated progress in science and engineering. Today we are exploring how AI might be applied in music.</p>
<p>But, as technology, there seems to be something different with AI. It is not a passive technology like a drum stick, a guitar pedal or a digital audio workstation. AI proposes, recommends, directs, and its uses can be from a simple parameter control in mastering to a complete generated composed work. It has an agency beyond earlier technologies.</p>
<p>In this talk, I seek to demystify the role of AI in music, discuss the nature of creative AI, and introduce a grounded view that is far from the popular AI-hype or doomsday prophesies which we often read about. I will also introduce the Intelligent Instruments project, as an example of an approach to AI where we apply the latest technologies in machine learning as a technique in making more interesting and personal musical instruments.</p>`;
