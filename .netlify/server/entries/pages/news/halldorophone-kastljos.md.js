<p>On January 17th, news reporter Gu\xF0r\xFAn S\xF3ley and the good people of Kastlj\xF3s, one of Iceland\u2019s most prestigious news and culture comment programme, paid us a visit at the Intelligent Instruments Lab. The occasion was the gifting of a halldorophone (Icelandic: d\xF3r\xF3f\xF3nn) to the Iceland University of the Arts, with the support Design Fund Iceland. A ceremony was held at the IUA and rector Fr\xED\xF0a Bj\xF6rk Ingvarsd\xF3ttir received the instrument on behalf of the school. </p>
<p>In the news segment we take a look at the halldorophone, a built-to-feedback, electro-acoustic string instrument invented by Halld\xF3r \xDAlfarsson (our technician at the IIL). Halld\xF3r goes on to tell the story of how the project came to be, originally conceived of as a prop for performance art during his time as a visual arts student. Starting out as kind of a joke, he says, but in time developed into a functional string instrument for string players interested in working with feedback.</p>
<p>The halldorophone has recently received support from Technology Development Fund Iceland. In a project called \u201CEvolution of halldorophones\u201D select musical institutions will receive halldorophone on loan in for a period of two years, allowing musicians and students access to the instrument and collecting data for Halld\xF3r to further development of the project. </p>

<p>Sigur\xF0ur Halld\xF3rsson, professor and head of musical department at Iceland University of the Arts, demonstrated the halldorophone for those present and told us about his feelings about the instrument. He said he had expected something familiar to a trained cellist, but coming to understand that this was a fundamentally different musical tool with a mind of its own. He expressed an understanding to have to put aside his training in order to be able embrace the new adventures this instrument offers.</p>
<p>The halldorophone has become somewhat known after composer Hildur Gu\xF0nad\xF3ttir was awarded the Academy Awards for her music in the film Joker, as she used the instrument to write and perform music in the film. Particularly in a scene called Bathroom Dance, where the main character transforms from a victim to perpetrator. Halld\xF3r is grateful for her contribution to the instrument\u2019s recognition, as she has regularly mentioned the halldorophone when interviewed about her work.</p>

<p>Futhermore, Halld\xF3r adds how pleasing it is that the halldorophone will now be available to the staff and students of the Iceland Academy of the Arts, suggesting that a musical instrument doesn\u2019t really exist if no one makes music with it. </p>
<p>Gu\xF0r\xFAn S\xF3ley dropped by at the Yellow Lab after the ceremony and Thor Magnusson, our primary investigator, showed her some of the instruments we are studying, making and playing. He explained how this lab seeks to understand how artificial intelligence becomes a part of music. Among the instruments we saw were the Linnstrument, AI embedded traditional Icelandic Langspil and the Basque Txalaparta. Thor explains how instruments have a close relationship with the players and how embedding AI can allow the instrument to suggest new ways of playing and composing.</p>
