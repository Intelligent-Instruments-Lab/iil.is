Inspired by the local Icelandic arts and music scene and I have worked with the Reykav\xEDk Dance Festival, Sequences Art Festival, Nylistasafni\xF0, Kling og Bang, Listah\xE1ti\xF0, Raflost, Rask, Mengi, Spectral Assault Records, and grassroots organizations Post-Dreifing, RUSL Fest, F\xFAsk, and King og Bong. My primary goal as an artist is to create an engaging experience that encourages interaction through the performative nature of objects and the sensation of experience."
